  ## repository without any changes. So in order to override some default genoverse functionality in Ensembl,
  ## there's a different folder 'ensembl' inside genoverse plugin's htdocs/genoverse folder. To make sure the
  ## code overrides the main genoverse one, each file from the 'ensembl' folder needs to be loaded immidiately
  ## after the corresponding core file is loaded. Also if there are further plugins to any of the files, they
  ## need to be loaded immidiately after the ones in 'ensembl' folder. To add to the complexity, all files
  ## should be ordered according to the order specified in GENOVERSE_FILES_ORDER and the files that are not
  ## mentioned in GENOVERSE_FILES_ORDER should be ignored from the 'genoverse' code.

<h1>Mailing Lists</h1>

<p>
The Ensembl mailing lists are ideal for programmers, code and installation discussions.
</p>


<h2>Ensembl Mailing Lists</h2>

<p>
Ensembl is an open collaborative project.
We are informal and coordinate much of our work by open e-mail lists.
There are two mailing lists on Ensembl:
</p>

<dl>

<dt id="announce">announce</dt>
<dd>
A low volume mailing list used to announce major updates and major releases. [<a href="http://lists.ensembl.org/ensembl-announce/threads.html">Old archive</a>] [<a href="http://lists.ensembl.org/pipermail/announce/">New archive</a>]
</dd>

<dt id="dev">dev</dt>
<dd>A high volume mailing list for Ensembl development, open to all. [<a href="http://lists.ensembl.org/ensembl-dev/threads.html">Old archive</a>] [<a href="http://lists.ensembl.org/pipermail/dev/">New archive</a>]

<p>
This is a mailing list with all the Ensembl developers and people who are just tracking the project.
We would encourage people to take questions and suggestions of small collaborations to ensembl-dev.
Internally we discuss all requests across all team members who are relevant.
</p>
<p>Please see below for detailed <a href="#guidelines">posting guidelines</a>, which we expect all users of the list to adhere to.</p> 
</dd>

<h3 id="guidelines">Ensembl dev posting guidelines</h3>

<p class="space-below">The Ensembl dev mailing list 
(<a href="mailto:dev@ensembl.org">dev@ensembl.org</a>) is a forum for users of the 
Ensembl API, website and data including users maintaining Ensembl mirrors
or developing applications based on the Ensembl code.  All API/web installation 
questions, issues, possible bugs or other Ensembl code related queries are 
appropriate for this forum. </p>

<p>Please keep in mind that many of the users posting here are volunteering 
their expertise.  <strong>While help is happily provided, there is an expectation that users
will spend the necessary time learning the system from the <a href="/info/">available documentation</a></strong>.</p>


<h4>General information</h4>

<ul>
<li>Before posting users are encouraged to search the 
<a href="http://lists.ensembl.org/pipermail/dev/">dev list archives</a>.

</ul>

<h4>How to format specific question types</h4>

<ul>
<li>If you are posting a question about the Ensembl API, please provide the

<pre class="code">

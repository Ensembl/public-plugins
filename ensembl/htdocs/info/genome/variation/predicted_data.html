<h2 id="consequences">Calculated variant consequences</h2>

<p>
For each variant that is mapped to the reference genome, we identify each
Ensembl transcript that overlap the variant. We then use a rule-based approach to
predict the effects that each allele of the variant may have on the transcript.
The set of consequence terms, defined by the <a rel="external"
href="http://www.sequenceontology.org">Sequence Ontology</a> (SO), that can be
currently assigned to each combination of an allele and a transcript is shown
in the table below. Note that each allele of each variant may have a different
effect in different transcripts. 
</p>

<p> 
This approach is applied to all germline variants and somatic mutations
stored in the Ensembl variation databases (though we do not yet currently calculate
consequences for structural variants). The resulting consequence type calls,
along with information determined as part of the process, such as the cDNA and
CDS coordinates, and the affected codons and amino acids in coding transcripts,
are stored in the Ensembl Variation database and displayed on the website. You can use 
this pipeline for your own data via the <a href="/info/docs/tools/vep">VEP</a>. 
</p>

<p>
We used <a rel="external" href="http://www.sequenceontology.org">SO terms</a> by default since the Ensembl release 68. There is an equivalent 
SO term for each of our old Ensembl terms but in a few cases there is a more specific 
SO term available, as shown in the table below. If you have text files or VEP outputs 
with our old Ensembl terms, you can easily update these to using the SO terms by running the following

<h2 id="nsSNP">Protein function predictions</h2>

<p>
For human mutations that are predicted to result in an amino acid substitution we 
provide SIFT and PolyPhen predictions for the effect of this substitution on
protein function. We compute the predictions for each of these tools for all possible 
single amino acid substitutions in the Ensembl human proteome. This means we can provide 
predictions for novel mutations for VEP and API users. We were able to compute predictions
from at least one tool for over 95% of the human proteins in Ensembl. 
SIFT predictions are also available for chicken, cow, dog, horse, mouse, pig, rat sheep and zebrafish.
</p>

<p>
These tools are developed by external groups and we provide a brief explanation of
the approach each takes below, and how we run it in Ensembl. For much more detail
please see the representative papers listed <a href="#references">below</a>, and the 
relevant publications available on each tool's website.

<h2 id="sift">SIFT</h2>

<p>
<a rel="external" href="http://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg">SIFT</a> predicts whether an amino acid 
substitution is likely to affect protein function based on sequence homology and the
physico-chemical similarity between the alternate amino acids. The data we provide for each amino
acid substitution is a score and a qualitative prediction (either 'tolerated' or 'deleterious'). 
The score is the normalized probability that the amino acid change is 
tolerated so scores nearer 0 are more likely to be deleterious.
The qualitative prediction is derived from this score such that substitutions with 
a score &lt; 0.05 are called 'deleterious' and all others are called 'tolerated'.
</p>

<p>
We ran <b>SIFT version <!-- sift_version - start -->5.2.2<!-- sift_version - end --></b> following the instructions from the authors and used SIFT
to choose homologous proteins rather than supplying them ourselves. We used all 
protein sequences available from <!-- sift_protein_db_version - start -->UniRef90 (release 2014_11)<!-- sift_protein_db_version - end --> as the protein database.

<h2 id="polyphen">PolyPhen</h2>

<p>
<a rel="external" href="http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/">PolyPhen-2</a> predicts
the effect of an amino acid substitution on the structure and function of a protein
using sequence homology, Pfam annotations, 3D structures from PDB where available, and
a number of other databases and tools (including DSSP, ncoils etc.). As with SIFT, for each amino
acid substitution where we have been able to calculate a prediction, we provide both a
qualitative prediction (one of 'probably damaging', 'possibly damaging', 'benign'
or 'unknown') and a score. The PolyPhen score represents the probability that a substitution 
is damaging, so values nearer 1 are more confidently predicted to be deleterious (note 
that this the opposite to SIFT). The qualitative prediction is based on the False 
Positive Rate of the classifier model used to make the predictions.
</p>

<p>
We ran <b>PolyPhen-2 version <!-- polyphen_version - start -->2.2.2<!-- polyphen_version - end -->, release <!-- polyphen_release - start -->405<!-- polyphen_release - end --></b> (available 
<a rel="external" href="http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/dokuwiki/downloads">here</a>)
following all instructions from the authors and using the UniProtKB UniRef100 (release 2013_10) 
non-redundant protein set as the protein database and DSSP (snapshot 22-Nov-2013) and PDB (snapshot 22-Nov-2013) 
as the structural databases. 
When computing the predictions we store results for the classifier models trained on the HumDiv 
and HumVar datasets. Both result sets are available through the variation API which defaults to HumVar if no selection is made.</a>

<h4 id="nsSNP_data_format">Prediction data format</h4>

<p>
The SIFT and PolyPhen predictions are precomputed and stored in the variation
databases and predictions are accessible in the variation API by using the <i>sift_prediction</i>, 
<i>sift_score</i>, <i>polyphen_prediction</i> and <i>polyphen_score</i> methods on a 
<i>Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::TranscriptVariationAllele</i> object. For users wanting
to access the complete set of predictions from the MySQL database or API, an explanation of
the format used is provided here.
</p>


<p>
The predictions and associated scores are stored as a matrix, with a column for 
each possible alternate amino acid and a row for each position in the translation. Each prediction
for a position and amino acid is stored as a 2-byte value which encodes both the qualitative
prediction and score encoded as described below. A simple example matrix is shown in the figure 
below, though note we only show the decoded score rather than the actual binary value stored
in the database.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/img/protein_function_prediction_matrix.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/img/protein_function_prediction_matrix.png" style="width:500px;heigth:143px" alt="protein function encoding"/>
</a>
</p>

<p>
Prediction matrices can be fetched and manipulated in a user-friendly manner using the variation API, specifically
using the <i>ProteinFunctionPredictionMatrixAdaptor</i> which allows you to fetch a prediction matrix
using either a transcript or a translation stable ID. This adaptor returns a <i>ProteinFunctionPredictionMatrix</i>
object and you can use the <i>get_prediction</i> method to retrieve a prediction for a given position
and amino acid. Users who want to use entire matrices should use the <i>deserialize</i> method to decode
an entire binary formatted matrix into a simple Perl hash. Please refer to the <a
href="/info/docs/api/variation/index.html">API documentation</a> for both 
of these classes for more details. For users who require direct access to the MySQL database (for instance 
because they are accessing the database in a language other than Perl) we provide a description of the 
binary format used below.
</p>

<p>
Prediction matrices for each translation from each of SIFT and PolyPhen are stored in the 
<i>protein_function_predictions</i> table. The analysis used to calculate the predictions
is identified in the <i>analysis_attrib_id</i> column which refers to a value stored in the
<i>attrib</i> table, and the protein sequence the predictions
apply to is identified by the <i>translation_md5_id</i> column which refers to a hexadecimal 
MD5 hash of the sequence stored in the <i>translation_md5</i> table. The 
prediction matrices are stored in the <i>prediction_matrix</i> column as a gzip compressed binary string.
Once uncompressed, this string contains a 40 byte substring for each row in the matrix
concatenated together in position order. Each row is composed of 20 2-byte predictions, 
one for each possible alternative amino acid in alphabetical order, though note that the 
value for the amino acid that matches the reference amino acid is 
identified as a 2-byte value with all bits set, or <i>0xFFFF</i> in hexadecimal notation. 
The prediction itself is packed as a 16 bit little-endian 
("VAX" order, or "v" format if using the perl <i>pack</i> subroutine) unsigned short value. 
The top 2 bits of this short 
are used to encode the qualitative prediction (PolyPhen has 4 possible values, while SIFT has just
2), and the bottom 10 bits are used to encode the prediction score. To decode the qualitative 
prediction you should mask off all bits except the top 2, and shift the resulting short
right by 14 bits and treat this as an integer between 0 and 3. The corresponding prediction can then 
be looked up in the table below. To decode the prediction score you should mask off the 
top 6 bits and the resulting value can be treated as a number between 0 and 1000, which 
should be divided by 1000 to give a 3 decimal place score (casting to a floating point type
if necessary). Bits 11-14 are not used, except to encode the "same as reference" dummy prediction 
<i>0xFFFF</i>.
</p>

<img src="/img/protein_function_encoding.png" style="width:500px;heigth:143px" alt="protein function encoding"/>

<p>
A diagram of the encoding scheme is shown above. In this example from a polyphen prediction, 
the top prediction bits are <i>0b01</i> which in decimal is the number 1, which corresponds to 
"possibly damaging" in the table below. The score bits are <i>0b1110001010</i> which in decimal 
is the number 906, which when divided by 1000, gives a score of 0.906.

<p>
To retrieve a prediction for a particular amino acid substitution at a given position
in a translation, first you must retrieve the binary matrix from the database and
uncompress it using gzip. You can calculate the offset into this string by multiplying 
the desired position (starting at 0) by 20 and then adding the index of the desired amino acid in an alphabetical ordering of
amino acids (also starting at 0), and then multiply this value by 2 to take into account the fact that each 
prediction uses 2 bytes. Each matrix also includes a 3 byte header used check if the data is corrupted etc. so
you will also need to add 3 to the calculated offset. The 2 bytes at the calculated position 
can then be extracted and the approach described above can be used to retrieve the prediction and score. 
A perl implementation of this scheme can be found in the <i>Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::ProteinFunctionPredictionMatrix</i>
module in the variation API and should hopefully inform attempts to reimplement this 
scheme in other languages.

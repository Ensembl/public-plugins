<h1 style="margin-top:15px">Ensembl Variation - Pathogenicity predictions</h1>
<p>
We provide results from a range of algorithms to help assess the potential pathogenicity of a variant. 
</p>
<p>
Genome-wide variant deleteriousness rankings from the <a href="#CADD">CADD</a> algorithm are available for human variants
and conservation scores are calculated for many species using <a href="#GERP">GERP</a>.
</p>
<p>
For human variants that are predicted to result in an <a href ="./predicted_data.html">amino acid substitution</a> we 
use SIFT and PolyPhen-2 to prediction the effect of the change on
protein function. We compute predictions for each of these tools for all possible 
single amino acid substitutions in the Ensembl human proteome. This enables us to provide 
predictions for novel mutations for VEP and API users. We were able to compute predictions
from at least one tool for over 95% of the human proteins in Ensembl. 
<br /> SIFT predictions are also available for cat, chicken, cow, dog, goat, horse, mouse, pig, rat, sheep and zebrafish.
</p>

<p>
Pathogenicity scores from <a href="#MutationAssessor"> MutationAssessor</a> 
and <a href="#MetaLR">MetaLR</a> are also available for human missense variants.
To improve compatibility with other resources, these scores are taken from dbNSFP (version 4.9c).
</p>

<p>
We provide a brief description of each of these tools and how they are made available in Ensembl. 
For more detail please see the representative papers listed <a href="#references">below</a>, 
and the relevant publications available on each tool's website. 
</p>

<br />
<h2>Genome wide scores</h2>

<p>
The level of conservation at a locus is strong predictor of the deleteriousness of any change. As an 
indicator change tolerance, we display GERP conservation scores on our variant pages. 
CADD scores are also available for human single nucleotide substitutions.

      The Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (<a rel="external" href="https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/">CADD</a>) tool scores
      the predicted deleteriousness of single nucleotide variants and insertion/deletions variants in the human genome by integrating
      multiple annotations including conservation and functional information into one metric.
      Phred-style CADD raw scores are displayed and variants with higher scores are more likely to be deleterious.
    </p>
    <p>CADD provides genome wide scores. These are displayed on our variant pages in the summary section as well as on transcript-specific variation tables.</p>
    <p>
      CADD provides a ranking rather than a prediction or default cut-off, with higher scores more likely to be deleterious.</p>
      For convenience, in our transcript tables we display scores above 30 as 'likely deleterious' and scores below as 'likely benign'. Variants with scores
      over 30 are predicted to be the 0.1% most deleterious possible substitutions in the human genome.<br />
      <b>We strongly recommend the actual score is used when assessing a variant and a cut-off appropriate to your requirements is chosen.</b>
    </p>
    <p>CADD scores are taken from the <a rel="external" href="https://cadd.gs.washington.edu/download">CADD</a> project web site (version v1.7) for

<h2> Algorithms to evaluate missense variants</h2>

<p>We provide results from a number of algorithms to help evaluate the impact of variants predicted change a genes peptide sequence.</p>
<p>In our transcript tables, we display colour-coded scores for each algorithm to support immediate assessment of a set of
variants, but recommend the actual scores are taken into account when interpreting the impact
of an individual variant. This is especially important for CADD which do not have
default cut-offs for different possible levels of deleteriousness. Our tables displaying the
variants found within a transcript can be filtered on the appropriate cut-offs for a specific investigation.

    <h2 id="sift">SIFT</h2>

<p>
<a rel="external" href="http://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg">SIFT</a> predicts whether an amino acid 
substitution is likely to affect protein function based on sequence homology and the
physico-chemical similarity between the alternate amino acids. The data we provide for each amino
acid substitution is a score and a qualitative prediction (either 'tolerated' or 'deleterious'). 
The score is the normalized probability that the amino acid change is 
tolerated so scores nearer zero are more likely to be deleterious.
The qualitative prediction is derived from this score such that substitutions with 
a score &lt; 0.05 are called 'deleterious' and all others are called 'tolerated'.
</p>

<p>
We ran <b>SIFT version <!-- sift_version - start -->6.2.1<!-- sift_version - end --></b> following the instructions from the authors and used SIFT
to choose homologous proteins rather than supplying them ourselves. We used all

<p>
<a rel="external" href="http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/">PolyPhen-2</a> predicts
the effect of an amino acid substitution on the structure and function of a protein
using sequence homology, Pfam annotations, 3D structures from PDB where available, and
a number of other databases and tools (including DSSP, ncoils etc.). As with SIFT, for each amino
acid substitution where we have been able to calculate a prediction, we provide both a
qualitative prediction (one of 'probably damaging', 'possibly damaging', 'benign'
or 'unknown') and a score. The PolyPhen score represents the probability that a substitution 
is damaging, so values nearer one are more confidently predicted to be deleterious (note 
that this the opposite to SIFT). The qualitative prediction is based on the False 
Positive Rate of the classifier model used to make the predictions.
</p>

<p>
We ran <b>PolyPhen-2 version <!-- polyphen_version - start -->2.2.3<!-- polyphen_version - end -->, release <!-- polyphen_release - start -->405c<!-- polyphen_release - end --></b> (available

<h2 id="nsSNP_data_format">Prediction data format</h2>

<p>
Precomputed predictions and scores for missense variants are stored in the variation
databases and are accessible in the variation API by using methods such as <i>sift_prediction</i>, 
<i>sift_score</i>, <i>polyphen_prediction</i> and <i>polyphen_score</i>  on a 
<i>Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::TranscriptVariationAllele</i> object. For anyone wishing
to access the complete set of predictions from the MySQL database or API, an explanation of
the format used is provided here.
</p>


<p>
The predictions and associated scores are stored as a matrix, with a column for 
each possible alternate amino acid and a row for each position in the translation. Each prediction
for a position and amino acid is stored as a 2-byte value which encodes both the qualitative
prediction and score encoded as described below. A simple example matrix is shown in the figure 
below, though note we only show the decoded score rather than the actual binary value stored
in the database.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/img/protein_function_prediction_matrix.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/img/protein_function_prediction_matrix.png" style="width:500px;heigth:143px" alt="protein function encoding"/>
</a>
</p>

<p>
Prediction matrices can be fetched and manipulated in a user-friendly manner using the variation API, specifically
using the <i>ProteinFunctionPredictionMatrixAdaptor</i> which allows you to fetch a prediction matrix
using either a transcript or a translation stable ID. This adaptor returns a <i>ProteinFunctionPredictionMatrix</i>
object and you can use the <i>get_prediction</i> method to retrieve a prediction for a given position
and amino acid. If you want to use entire matrices, you should use the <i>deserialize</i> method to decode
an entire binary formatted matrix into a simple Perl hash. Please refer to the <a
href="/info/docs/Doxygen/variation-api/index.html">API documentation</a> for both 
of these classes for more details. If you require direct access to the MySQL database (for instance 
because they are accessing the database in a language other than Perl) we provide a description of the 
binary format used below.
</p>

<p>
Prediction matrices for each translation from each of SIFT and PolyPhen are stored in the 
<i>protein_function_predictions</i> table. The analysis used to calculate the predictions
is identified in the <i>analysis_attrib_id</i> column which refers to a value stored in the
<i>attrib</i> table, and the protein sequence the predictions
apply to is identified by the <i>translation_md5_id</i> column which refers to a hexadecimal 
MD5 hash of the sequence stored in the <i>translation_md5</i> table. The 
prediction matrices are stored in the <i>prediction_matrix</i> column as a gzip compressed binary string.
Once uncompressed, this string contains a 40 byte substring for each row in the matrix
concatenated together in position order. Each row is composed of 20 2-byte predictions, 
one for each possible alternative amino acid in alphabetical order, though note that the 
value for the amino acid that matches the reference amino acid is 
identified as a 2-byte value with all bits set, or <i>0xFFFF</i> in hexadecimal notation. 
The prediction itself is packed as a 16 bit little-endian 
("VAX" order, or "v" format if using the perl <i>pack</i> subroutine) unsigned short value. 
The top two bits of this short 
are used to encode the qualitative prediction (PolyPhen has four possible values, while SIFT has just
two), and the bottom ten bits are used to encode the prediction score. To decode the qualitative 
prediction you should mask off all bits except the top two, and shift the resulting short
right by 14 bits and treat this as an integer between zero and three. The corresponding prediction can then 
be looked up in the table below. To decode the prediction score you should mask off the 
top six bits and the resulting value can be treated as a number between zero and 1000, which 
should be divided by 1000 to give a three decimal place score (casting to a floating point type
if necessary). Bits 11-14 are not used, except to encode the "same as reference" dummy prediction 
<i>0xFFFF</i>.
</p>

<img src="/img/protein_function_encoding.png" style="width:500px;heigth:143px" alt="protein function encoding"/>

<p>
A diagram of the encoding scheme is shown above. In this example from a polyphen prediction, 
the top prediction bits are <i>0b01</i> which in decimal is the number 1, which corresponds to 
"possibly damaging" in the table below. The score bits are <i>0b1110001010</i> which in decimal 
is the number 906, which when divided by 1000, gives a score of 0.906.

<p>
To retrieve a prediction for a particular amino acid substitution at a given position
in a translation, first you must retrieve the binary matrix from the database and
uncompress it using gzip. You can calculate the offset into this string by multiplying 
the desired position (starting at zero) by 20 and then adding the index of the desired amino acid in an alphabetical ordering of
amino acids (also starting at zero), and then multiply this value by two to take into account the fact that each 
prediction uses two bytes. Each matrix also includes a three byte header used check if the data is corrupted etc. so
you will also need to add three to the calculated offset. The two bytes at the calculated position 
can then be extracted and the approach described above can be used to retrieve the prediction and score. 
A perl implementation of this scheme can be found in the <i>Bio::EnsEMBL::Variation::ProteinFunctionPredictionMatrix</i>
module in the variation API and should hopefully inform attempts to reimplement this 
scheme in other languages.

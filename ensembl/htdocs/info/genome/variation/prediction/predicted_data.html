<h1 style="margin-top:15px">Ensembl Variation - Calculated variant consequences</h1>

<p>
For each variant that is mapped to the reference genome, we identify all 
overlapping Ensembl transcripts. We then use a rule-based approach to
predict the effects that each allele of the variant may have on each transcript.
The set of consequence terms, defined by the <a rel="external"
href="http://www.sequenceontology.org">Sequence Ontology</a> (SO), that can be
currently assigned to each combination of an allele and a transcript is shown
in the table below. Note that each allele of each variant may have a different
effect in different transcripts. 
</p>

<p> 
This approach is applied to all germline variants and somatic mutations
stored in the Ensembl databases. The resulting consequence type calls,
along with information determined as part of the process, such as the cDNA and
CDS coordinates, and the affected codons and amino acids in coding transcripts,
are stored in the Ensembl Variation database and displayed on our website. 
For human and mouse variants any overlap with regulatory features is also displayed.
For structural variants consequence terms are calculated on the fly for display 
on our website or API access. 
You can use this pipeline to annotate your own data via <a href="/info/docs/tools/vep">VEP</a>. 
By default, VEP will include upstream and downstream annotations for variants within 5kb of a nearby feature, see <kbd>--distance</kbd> in <a href="/info/docs/tools/vep/script/vep_options.html#output">VEP options</a>.
</p>

<p style="padding-top:15px">
See below a diagram showing the location of each display 
term relative to the transcript structure:

</a>

<p style="padding-top:10px">
The terms in the table below are <b>shown in order of severity</b> (more severe to less severe) as estimated by
Ensembl, and this ordering is used on the website summary views. This ordering
is necessarily subjective and API and VEP users can always get the full set of
consequences for each allele and make their own severity judgement. The 
<a href="/Help/Glossary?id=535" class="popup">IMPACT rating</a> 
is a separate rating given for compatibility with other variant
annotation tools (e.g. <a href="http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/">snpEff</a>).

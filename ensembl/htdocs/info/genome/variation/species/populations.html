  <h1 style="margin-top:15px">Ensembl Variation - Population allele frequencies & genotypes</h1>

<p>We provide allele frequency data from a range of different projects including the 1000 Genomes Project and the genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD).<br />Genotype data is also available for a number of studies including the 1000 Genomes Project and NextGen livestock project.
Frequencies displayed (to three decimal places) may not add up to one due to rounding.
<br />


<h2 id="maf">Minor Alleles</h2>

<p>
Minor alleles and their frequencies are available for variants discovered in the 1000 Genomes Project.<br />
These are calculated by dbSNP. If there are more than <b>two</b> alleles, the <b>second most common</b> is reported 
(See example: <a href="/Homo_sapiens/Variation/Population?v=rs200077393">rs200077393</a>).<br />
This allows <b>common variants</b> to be distinguished from <b>rare variants</b> in situations where deep sequencing 
has identified a third rare allele.

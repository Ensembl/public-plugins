<p>The CVASU_BBG_1.0 assembly was submitted by Bangladesh Goat Genome Consortium (BGGC) on March 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 3,696,314 contigs assembled into 3,972 scaffolds. From these sequences, 29 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 819 while the scaffold N50 is 102,339,471.</p>

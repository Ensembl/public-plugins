<h1>Ensembl Gene Set</h1>

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
Gene annotation provided by Ensembl includes both automatic annotation, 
i.e. genome-wide determination of transcripts, and manual curation, i.e. 
reviewed determination of transcripts on a case-by-case basis (in this 
case limited to some species such as human and mouse). Furthermore, 
Ensembl imports annotation from <a href="http://flybase.org/">FlyBase</a>, 
<a href="http://www.wormbase.org/">WormBase</a> and 
<a href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/">SGD</a>. Ensembl transcripts
displayed on our website are products of the Ensembl automatic
pipeline, termed the Ensembl genebuild. All Ensembl transcripts are
based on experimental evidence and thus the automated pipeline relies
on the mRNAs and protein sequences deposited into public databases
from the scientific community. Manually-curated transcripts produced
by the <a rel="external"
href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/vertebrategenome/havana/">HAVANA</a> group at the
Welcome Trust Sanger Institute are displayed in a separate track on
our website.
</p>

<p>
An Ensembl gene (with a unique ENSG... ID) includes any spliced
transcripts (ENST...) with overlapping coding sequence. Transcripts
from the Ensembl genebuild (see below), the Havana/Vega set and the
Consensus Coding Sequence (<a href="ccds.html">CCDS</a>) set may all
be clustered into the same gene. Transcripts that belong to the same
gene ID may differ in splice events, exons, and can give rise to very
different proteins. These are isoforms, arising from alternative
splicing. Transcript clusters with no overlapping coding sequence are
annotated as separate genes. Two transcripts may overlap in non-coding
sequence (ie. intronic sequence or UnTranslated Region (UTR), and be
classified under two separate genes. After the Ensembl gene and
transcript sequences are defined, the gene and transcript names
(<a href="#Names">see below</a>) are assigned.
</p>

<h2 id="Annotation">Genebuild</h2>
<p>
Standard Ensembl genebuilds are performed on high-coverage genomes and
usually take at least four months to complete. While the genebuild
process is tailored to each species according to the data that are
available, the main steps followed in a standard genebuild are the
same for every species.
</p>

<p>
The initial set-up for a genebuild involves loading the assembly into
an Ensembl schema datababase and then running several analyses across
the genome including masking of repeats and <em>ab initio</em> gene
predictions. The <em>ab initio</em> gene predictions are run for
website display purposes only and are not used as supporting evidence
for the gene structures displayed on our website.
</p>

<p>
The first stage of the genebuild is known as the Targetted
stage. Here, species-specific proteins are aligned to the genome and
Genewise is used to build a transcript structure for the protein on
the genome. 
</p>

<p>
The Targetted stage is followed by the Similarity stage in which
proteins from closely related species are used to build transcript
structure in regions were a Targetted transcript structure is
absent. For those species having a lot of experimentally-generated
protein sequences, the Targetted stage tends to contribute most of the
gene structures in the genebuild. However, for species with fewer
species-specific protein sequences the Similarity stage plays a much
more important role in predicting gene structures.
</p>

<p>
The next stage in the genebuild is to align species-specific cDNA and
EST sequences to the genome. Where cDNA alignments overlap transcripts
predicted in the preceding stages, any non-translated region from the
cDNA is spliced onto the transcript prediction as UTR. EST alignments
are displayed on our website but are usually not used as supporting
evidence in the genebuild.
</p>

<p>
The final set of gene predictions is obtained by merging identical
transcripts built from different proteins sequences to produce
multi-transcript gene predictions, each with a non-redundant set of
transcripts models. For every transcript model, the protein and mRNA
sequences used to predict the model is viewable in the browser as
'supporting evidence'. These can also be obtained using
the <a href="/info/docs/api/">Perl API</a>.
</p>

<p>
Once a 'final' gene set has been obtained, a number of post-processing
procedures are applied to filter and annotate the predicted
genes. These include protein domain annotation, ncRNA annotation,
pseudogene prediction and cross-referencing to external databases.
</p>

<p>
The human and mouse genebuilds involve additional steps not included
in the standard Ensembl build. For both species, transcripts from the
Consensus Coding Sequence (<a href="ccds.html">CCDS</a>) set are
imported directly and not altered by the genebuild process. In
addition, where manual curation is available for a transcript, the
Ensembl and HAVANA transcript models are compared. The Ensembl and
HAVANA models are merged when they agree on the same coding
sequence. Merged models will be coloured gold in the browser. A
merged, or golden, gene indicates one or more common transcripts
between Ensembl and HAVANA. This combined geneset is the default gene
set from the <a href="http://www.gencodegenes.org">GENCODE project</a>.
</p>

<p>
The genebuild process for <a href="2x_genomes.html">low-coverage
genomes</a> does not follow that of the standard Ensembl genebuild
described above.

<h2 id="Sources">Sources of Supporting Evidence for a Transcript</h2>
<p>
Ensembl transcripts are based on mRNA and protein from the following
databases. If you do not find a transcript that you expected in
Ensembl, make sure there is sequence submitted into these databases.
If the sequence is missing, consider submitting your experimental
evidence to <a rel="external"

<h2 id="Names">Gene Names and External References</h2>
<p>
Most human genes have an associated HGNC symbol from
the <a rel="external" href="http://www.genenames.org/">HUGO Gene
Nomenclature Committee</a>. If the gene or transcript comes from the
Ensembl Genebuild's automated pipeline only, the HGNC symbol will have
HGNC automatic associated with it. If it is a manually curated
transcript from Havana/Vega, it will have HGNC curated associated with
it.
</p>

<p>
'Clone-based' identifiers apply to transcripts that cannot be
associated with an HGNC symbol and are either assigned by Ensembl or
Havana, as above.
</p>
<p>
The list of gene name catagories for human is as follows:
</p>

<ol>
<li>HGNC automatic</li>
<li>HGNC curated</li>
<li>Clone-based ensembl</li>
<li>Clone-based vega</li>
</ol>

<p>
A new number follows each transcript name. If the number starts with
'0', e.g. 001, 002, etc., this is a merged or manually curated transcript from
Havana/Vega.  If the number starts with '2', such as 200, 201,...,
this is an automatically annotated transcript from Ensembl.  This does
not take the place of the Ensembl gene ID, ENSG..., which is stable
from release to release, and has not changed.  The goal is to be more
consistent with the naming of our manually curated imports from
Havana.
</p>

<h2 id="Status">Gene Status</h2>

<p>
Ensembl genes and transcripts are classified
as <strong>known</strong>, 
<strong>novel</strong> or <strong>merged</strong>.
</p>

<p>
A known gene or transcript matches to a sequence in a public,
scientific database such as UniProtKB and NCBI RefSeq. The match must
be for the same species, otherwise the gene is considered to be novel
for that species. Ensembl-Havana merges occur when a manually
annotated transcript from the Havana project matches to the  Ensembl
coding sequence exactly. Ensembl-Havana merged transcripts are
limited to human and mouse. Matches to IDs in other databases, such as
UniProtKB and NCBI EntrezGene, are listed under External References in
the Transcript tab.
</p>

<p>
Known <a href="/info/docs/genebuild/ncrna.html">miRNAs</a> must
have a match in miRBase for the same species.
</p>

<h2 id="Other">Other transcripts</h2>
<p>
Ig segments, non-coding RNA and transient EST gene models are also
automatically annotated by Ensembl.  The genes based on ESTs, or
Expressed Sequence Tags, can be a good starting point to determine new
isoforms.  However, these models are not as robust as the known and
novel protein-coding set, as ESTs have a high degree of error in their
sequence.  This may not be the case for some human sets, but in the
majority, the mRNA and protein sequences used in the main gene set
determination are more reliable.  EST genes have 'EST' in the
identifier, such as 'ENSESTG' for a human Ensembl EST gene.  They can
also be used to identify the presence of mRNA, as a confirmation that
a transcript is expressed.
</p>

<p>
Transcripts are scanned for pseudogene behaviour or false coding
sequence.  A transcript is considered a <strong>pseudogene </strong>if
1 of these 4 criteria are met:
</p>

<ol>
<li>It is a single exon transcript and it matches a multi-exon
transcript elsewhere in the genome.
</li>
<li>The transcript  is completely masked out by repeat masker.</li>
<li>The transcript contains no introns and multiple frameshifts.</li>
<li>
The transcript contains frameshifts and all of the introns are &gt;80%
covered by repeats.
</li>
</ol>

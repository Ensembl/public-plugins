<p>The mBalMus1.v2 assembly was submitted by G10K on February 2020. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 1,050 contigs assembled into 130 scaffolds. From these sequences, 23 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 5,963,936 while the scaffold N50 is 110,470,125.</p>

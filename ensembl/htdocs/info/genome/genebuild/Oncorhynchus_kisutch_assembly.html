<p>The Okis_V2 assembly was submitted by University of Victoria on November 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 8,771 contigs assembled into 4,087 scaffolds. From these sequences, 30 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 1,159,298 while the scaffold N50 is 68,265,700.</p>

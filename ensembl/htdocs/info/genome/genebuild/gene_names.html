<h1>Gene Naming</h1>

<h2 id="humangenes">Human genes</h2>

<p>Most human protein-coding genes have an associated HGNC symbol from the <a href="http://www.genenames.org/">HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee</a>. ncRNA genes are given names from miRBase and RFAM. 'Clone-based' identifiers apply to transcripts that cannot be associated with an HGNC symbol.</p>

<p>The list of gene name categories for human is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>HGNC automatic</li>

<li>HGNC curated</li>

<li>Clone-based Ensembl</li>

<li>Clone-based Vega</li>
</ul>

<p>On occasion, the Hugo Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) review the approved gene names for a number of genes. This review process aims to assign gene names that describe gene function more accurately. Please see the <a href="http://www.genenames.org/">HGNC site</a> for more details as to which genes are more at risk of a likely change. Please note that previous symbols will be maintained as ‘synonyms’, however we recommend using the HGNC ID to ensure stability in your pipelines and analyses.</p>

<h2 id="otherspecies">Other species</h2>

<p>Mouse genes are named from <a href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/">MGI</a>, rat genes are named from <a href="http://rgd.mcw.edu/">RGD</a> and zebrafish genes are named from <a href="https://zfin.org/">ZFIN</a>. Other species have gene names imported from <a href="http://www.uniprot.org/">Uniprot</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene">NCBIGene</a>, or if this is not available, from the human, mouse, rat or zebrafish orthologue.</p>

<h2 id="transcriptnumbering">Transcript numbering</h2>

<p>Each transcript is named using the gene name, followed by a number. This does not take the place of the Ensembl gene ID, ENSG..., which is stable from release to release, and does not change.</p>

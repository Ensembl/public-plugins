<p>The CaiMos1.0 assembly was submitted by McDonnell Genome Institute - Washington University School of Medicine on January 2020. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 30,424 contigs assembled into 3,703 scaffolds. From these sequences, 29 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 89,133 while the scaffold N50 is 2,417,665.</p>

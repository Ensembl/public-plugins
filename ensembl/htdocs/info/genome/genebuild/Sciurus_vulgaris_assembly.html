<p>The mSciVul1.1 assembly was submitted by SC on December 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 1,807 contigs assembled into 638 scaffolds. From these sequences, 21 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 16,333,633 while the scaffold N50 is 153,872,958.</p>

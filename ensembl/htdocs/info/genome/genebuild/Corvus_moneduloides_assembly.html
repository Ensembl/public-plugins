<p>The UO_Cmon_1.0 assembly was submitted by University of Otago on November 2019. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 11,985 contigs assembled into 2,996 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 331,397 while the scaffold N50 is 4,457,533.</p>

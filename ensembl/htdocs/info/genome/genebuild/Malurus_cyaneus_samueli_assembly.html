<p>The mCya_1.0 assembly was submitted by Australian National University on December 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 18,228 contigs assembled into 4,330 scaffolds. From these sequences, 26 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 210,412 while the scaffold N50 is 68,113,514.</p>

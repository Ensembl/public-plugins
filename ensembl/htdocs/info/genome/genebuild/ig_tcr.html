<h1>Ig/Tcr Genes</h1>

<p>
Ensembl Ig Segment genes are annotations of the Immunoglobulin and
T-cell receptor genes present in germ-line genomic DNA. During B-cell
and T-cell maturation, these genes are rearranged and brought together
by V-D-J recombination to form functional Immunoglobulin and T-cell
receptor genes.
</p>

<p>
The protein and nucleotide databases contain many sequences of mature
Immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor genes. Inferring gene structures by
aligning these to the genome using the standard <a href="genome_annotation.html">Ensembl annotation</a> process pipeline gives
unsatisfactory results, for two main reasons:
</p>

<ul>

<li>
The non-coding DNA that separates pairs of gene segments brought
together by V-D-J recombination  is not an intron, and the gene
boundaries display different sequence signals to splice sites.
Spliced alignment programs such as 
<a rel="external"
href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gr.1865504">GeneWise</a> therefore
require retuning in order to predict the gene structure correctly.
</li>

<li>
Some genes comprise multiple exons. Delineating a "spliced" alignment
of a mature Immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor sequence to the genome into
its constituent segments is therefore not straightforward.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
For this reason, Immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor gene segments have
been annotated differently to other Ensembl genes. Ensembl makes use
of the 
<a rel="external" href="http://www.imgt.org/">IMGT database</a>, which
provides annotation of individual gene segments on reference
sequences. Ensembl extracts individual gene sequences and aligns them
to the genome using the
<a rel="external"
href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-6-31">Exonerate</a>
alignment tool.
</p>

<p>
To reflect their role in the V-D-J recombination process, segments are
annotated as belonging to one of four classes: V segment, D segment, J
segment and C segment.  At present, Ensembl Ig gene annotations are
only available for human and mouse.

<p>The fCycLum1.pri assembly was submitted by Vertebrate Genomes Project on December 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 396 contigs assembled into 49 scaffolds. From these sequences, 25 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 4,950,682 while the scaffold N50 is 23,863,342.</p>

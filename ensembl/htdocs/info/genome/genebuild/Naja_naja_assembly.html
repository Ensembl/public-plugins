<p>The Nana_v5 assembly was submitted by Genentech Inc., on December 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 13,805 contigs assembled into 1,897 scaffolds. From these sequences, 19 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 302,474 while the scaffold N50 is 224,088,900.</p>

<h1>Regulatory features</h1>

<p>Regions that are predicted to regulate gene expression are called <strong>Regulatory features</strong> in Ensembl. The different types of regulatory features annotated include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Promoters (regions at the 5' end of genes where transcription factors and RNA polymerase bind to initiate transcription)</li>
<li>Promoter flanking regions (transcription factor binding regions that flank the above)</li>
<li>Enhancers (regions that bind transcription factors and interact with promoters to stimulate transcription of distant genes)</li>
<li>CTCF binding sites (regions that bind CTCF, the insulator protein that demarcates open and closed chromatin)</li>
<li>Transcription factor binding sites (sites which bind transcription factors, for which no other role can be determined as yet)</li>
<li>Open chromatin regions (regions of spaced out histones, making them accessible to protein interactions)</li>
</ul>

<p>For each cell type the regulatory features are assigned labels to describe their activity levels. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>ACTIVE, when the feature displays an active epigenetic signature.</li>
<li>POISED, when the feature displays a epigenetic signature with the potential to be activated.</li>
<li>REPRESSED, when the feature is epigenetically repressed.</li>
<li>INACTIVE, when the region bears no epigenetic modifications from the ones included in the Regulatory Build.</li>
<li>NA, when there is no available data in the cell type for this feature.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Determination of regulatory features</h2>

<p>Regulatory features are inferred from <a href="/info/genome/funcgen/regulation_sources.html">publicly available experimental data sets</a>, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open chromatin assays (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNase-Seq">DNase-seq</a>)</li>
<li>Histone modification assays (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChIP-sequencing">ChIP-seq</a>)</li>
<li>Transcription factor binding assays (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChIP-sequencing">ChIP-seq</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, raw sequencing data are aligned against the reference genome and then a genome segmentation algorithm is applied to define genomic loci of distinct epigenomic profiles. Finally each epigenomic profile is classified into one type of regulatory features based on a decision tree that takes into consideration transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), gene annotation and histone modification signal enrichment. This process is called the <a href="regulatory_build.html">Regulatory Build</a>.</p>

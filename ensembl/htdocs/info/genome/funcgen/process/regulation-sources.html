	<h1>Source data</h1>
	<p>Regulatory features are generated using a variety of genome-wide assays, such as ATAC-seq, DNAase-seq, and ChIP-seq of histone marks and transcription factor binding.</p>

	<p>Regulatory features for human and mouse are based on data from the <a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/">ENCODE</a> project. 
		Annotation for farmed animal and aquaculture species are based on data from different <a href="https://www.animalgenome.org/community/FAANG">FAANG</a> projects.</p>

	<p>All primary data are available in <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home">ENA</a>, and are indexed and searchable in the <a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/ENCODE">ENCODE</a> or <a href="https://data.faang.org/dataset">FAANG</a> portals.</p>

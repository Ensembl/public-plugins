<h1>Regulatory features</h1>

<p>Genomic regions with primary data supporting a potential non-coding regulatory function are called <em>regulatory features</em> in Ensembl. The different types of regulatory features annotated include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Promoters</li>
<li>Enhancers</li>
<li>Open chromatin regions (without evidence to classify as a promoter or enhancer)</li>
<li>CTCF binding sites</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we indicate the location of Epigenetically Modified Accessible Regions (EMARs).</p>
<p>For each cell type (epigenome) regulatory features are assigned labels to describe their activity levels. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>ACTIVE, when the feature overlaps an open chromatin peak in the corresponding epigenome,</li>
<li>INACTIVE, when there is no corresponding open chromatin peak, and</li>
<li>NA, when there is no available data in the cell type for this feature.</li>
</ul>

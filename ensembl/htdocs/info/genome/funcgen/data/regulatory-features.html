<h1>Regulatory features</h1>

<p>Regions that have epigenomic marks associated with non-coding regulatory function are called <em>regulatory features</em> in Ensembl. The different types of regulatory features annotated include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Promoters</li>
<li>Enhancers</li>
<li>Open chromatin regions (with insufficient evidence to classify as a promoter or enhancer)</li>
<li>Transcription factor binding (enriched for TF binding, but lacking evidence to be classified as open chromatin, enhancer or promoter)</li>
<li>CTCF binding sites</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, promoters and enhancers share similar epigenomic features, but promoters are more likely to be found near a Transcription Start Site.</p>
<br/>
<p>For each cell type the regulatory features are assigned labels to describe their activity levels. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>ACTIVE, when the feature displays an active epigenetic signature.</li>
<li>POISED, when the feature displays a epigenetic signature with the potential to be activated.</li>
<li>REPRESSED, when the feature is epigenetically repressed.</li>
<li>INACTIVE, when the region bears no epigenetic modifications from the ones included in the Regulatory Build.</li>
<li>NA, when there is no available data in the cell type for this feature.</li>
</ul>

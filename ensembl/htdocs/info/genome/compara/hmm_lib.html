  <h1>TreeFam HMM library</h1>

  <p>
  The TreeFam HMM library is based upon the <a href="https://www.pantherdb.org/">Panther database</a> (version 9) <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>.
  In order to define a common and comprehensive set of HMMs to be used across all the Ensembl divisions we 
  added extra families defined in the TreeFam database (<a href="http://treefam.org">version 9</a>), and built new ones to model gene-families
  that were not previously described in either databases.

<h1 id="synteny">Synteny</h1>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synteny">Synteny</a> is the conserved order of aligned genomic blocks between species. It is calculated from the <a href="/info/genome/compara/analyses.html">pairwise genome alignments</a> created by Ensembl, when both species have a chromosome-level assembly.</p>

<p>The search is run in two phases:</p>

<ol>
<li>We search for alignment blocks that are in the same order in the two genomes. Syntenic alignments that are closer than 200 kb are grouped into a synteny block.</li>

<li>Groups that are in synteny are linked, provided that no more than two non-syntenic groups are found between them and they are less than 3 Mb apart.</li>
</ol>

<p>To avoid overly sparse syntenic views, a synteny dataset may be excluded
  if it has average genomic coverage below a threshold, typically 5%.

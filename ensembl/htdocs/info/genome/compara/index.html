<h1>Comparative Genomics</h1>

<p>
Ensembl Compara provides cross-species resources and analyses, at both the sequence level and the gene level. Below is a list of those resources.
</p>

<br/>
<h2 id="gene_resources">Gene-based resources</h2>

<p>
We automatically integrate the gene annotations produced by the <a href="/info/genome/genebuild/">Ensembl genebuild</a> team across all the species.
</p>

<h3>Phylogenetic trees</h3>

<p>
We compute phylogenetic trees across the whole set of protein-coding genes with one pipeline, and ncRNA genes with another.
They both result in a set of trees that are visualized and accessed the exact same way.
From both set of gene trees, we extract <strong>homologues</strong> (orthologues and paralogues).
We also analyze the gene gain and loss events using the <a href="http://sites.bio.indiana.edu/~hahnlab/Software.html">CAFE</a> software.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Protein trees</strong> are constructed using a representative protein for every gene in Ensembl: proteins are clustered using <a href="http://treesoft.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/treesoft/branches/lh3/hcluster/">hcluster_sg</a> based on <a href="http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download">NCBI BLAST+</a> e-values, and each cluster of proteins is aligned using <a href="http://www.tcoffee.org/Projects_home_page/m_coffee_home_page.html">M-Coffee</a> or <a href="http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/">Mafft</a>.
Finally, <a href="https://github.com/muffato/treebest">TreeBeST</a> is used to produce a gene tree from each multiple alignment, reconciling it with the species tree to call duplication events.

</li>

<li>
<strong>ncRNA trees</strong> are constructed using gene families represented in <a href="http://rfam.janelia.org/">RFAM</a>, for which a specific covariance model is provided.
For each gene family, we build several trees using secondary structure alignments with <a href="http://infernal.janelia.org/">INFERNAL</a> and genomic alignments with <a href="http://wasabiapp.org/software/prank/">PRANK</a>.
All the trees are merged into a final tree using <a href="https://github.com/muffato/treebest">TreeBeST</a>.

</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ensembl Families</h3>

<p>
We also extend our gene-based resources to the whole set of Metazoan proteins from <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/">UniProtKB SwissProt and SPTREMBL</a> in a resource named <strong>Ensembl Families</strong>.
Briefly, the pipeline builds similarity clusters with <a href="http://micans.org/mcl/">MCL</a> on the set of all Ensembl proteins (potentially several per gene), and the above-mentionned set of UniProt proteins.
Clusters are then aligned with <a href="http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/">Mafft</a>.

</p>

<h3>Stable ID mapping</h3>

<p>
Ensembl Families and Protein Trees undergo a step of <strong>stable IDs</strong> mapping, that allows one to track the update of a tree or a family across releases.
Please note that the mapping exclusively relates to the content, and not to the actual conservation of the alignment or tree topology.
<a href="stable_ids.html">More information &rarr;</a>.
<br/>
ncRNA trees can be naturally mapped across releases using their RFAM identifier.

<h2 id="seq_resource">Sequence-based resources</h2>

<h3>Whole genome alignments</h3>

<p>
Sometimes abbreviated as WGA, they are performed either pairwise between two species, or using multiple species.
Pairwise alignments are based on <a href="http://www.bx.psu.edu/~rsharris/lastz/">lastZ-net</a> (although we have not recomputed all the previous <a href="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/13/1/103">BlastZ-net</a> and <a href="http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/12/4/656">translated-Blat</a> alignments).
Multiple alignments are mainly based on the <a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/18/11/1814">EPO pipeline</a> (extended to include fragmented genomes) and <a href="http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~cdewey/mercator/">Mercator</a>/<a href="http://github.com/benedictpaten/pecan">Pecan</a>.
<a href="analyses.html">More information &rarr;</a>
</p>

<p>
Following is the list of additional analysis that are applied on the whole-genome alignments:
</p>

<h3>Ancestral sequences</h3>

<p>
From the multiple alignments performed with the EPO pipeline, we can predict ancestral sequences for a number of ancestral taxa.
<a href="analyses.html#ancestral">More information &rarr;</a>
</p>

<h3>Age of Base (<i>Beta</i>)</h3>

<p>
In turn, from these ancestral events, we estimate when mutation events occurred along the species tree. This experimental track 
is currently computed only for substitutions along the human lineage. 
<a href="analyses.html#age_of_base">More information &rarr;</a>
</p>

<h3>Conservation scores and constrained elements</h3>

<p>
On the multiple alignments performed with the EPO and EPO-2X pipelines, we run <a href="http://mendel.stanford.edu/SidowLab/downloads/gerp/">GERP</a> to compute conservation scores and extract regions that are significantly conserved.
<a href="analyses.html#conservation">More information &rarr;</a>
</p>

<h3>Syntenies</h3>

<p>
Finally, we can derive synteny mappings from the pairwise alignments of species whose genome assembly is not too fragmented.

<h2 id="species_tree">Species tree</h2>

<p>
The Compara pipelines use various species trees.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Protein-trees pipeline follows the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.html/">NCBI taxonomy</a>.</li>
	<li>The ncRNA-trees pipeline uses the NCBI taxonomy as a base and flattens the three following sub-trees: <em>Eutheria</em>, <em>Sauria</em>, and <em>Clupeocephala</em>.</li>
	<li>The CAFE pipelines (Gene Gain/Loss trees) also follows the NCBI taxonomy, and use <a href="http://www.timetree.org">the TimeTree database</a> for the branch lengths.</li>
	<li>The Alignment pipelines follow a binary species tree that is maintained in-house (in accordance with the litterature). A Newick file representing this topology (without branch lengths) is on <a href="https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-compara/blob/release/[[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]]/scripts/pipeline/species_tree.eukaryotes.topology.nw">GitHub</a>.</li>
	<li>The Constrained Elements / Conservation Scores pipelines need branch lengths, and we compute branch lengths for 4 sub-trees of the previous tree by running phyloFit (part of the <a href="http://compgen.bscb.cornell.edu/phast/">PHAST</a> package) on our multiple alignments (see <a href="#seq_resource">above</a>). They are available in Newick format on GitHub:

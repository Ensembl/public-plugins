<h1>Age of Base</h1>

<p>From the calculated ancestral sequences, we infer the <b>age of a base</b>, i.e. the timing of the most recent mutation for each base of the genome. Each position of the genome is compared to its immediate inferred ancestor, then its ancestor, etc. until a difference is found. The inferred substitution event therefore occurred on a specific branch of the tree, which is identified by all the extant species which eventually descended from that branch, as illustrated below.</p>

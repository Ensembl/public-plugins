<h2>About Archive Ensembl</h2>

<p><img src="/img/generic-archive-roundel.gif" alt="Archive_ensembl" class="float-left" style="width:120px;height=:120px" />The main Ensembl site <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/">www.ensembl.org</a> is updated with the latest data on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>The Ensembl Archive sites have been set up so there is a stable link 
for three years to pages from a particular release (e.g. version 56 from 
September 2009) in Ensembl.</p>

<p>These links will be suitable for referring to Ensembl pages in publications.</p>

<p>A few older archives may be maintained if they include significant datasets for key species, 
but the availability of these sites cannot be guaranteed.</p>

<p>As from August 2014 we are providing a version of Ensembl
      supporting the <a href="http://grch37.ensembl.org" target="blank">GRCh37
        human assembly</a>. Unlike the usual Ensembl archive sites, this will be
      maintained and updated with new features with each release of Ensembl.</p>

<p>For all enquiries, please <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/Help/Contact" class="popup">contact the Ensembl HelpDesk</a>. </p>

        class="float-left" style="width:120px;height=:120px" />The main Ensembl
      site (www.ensembl.org) and the mirror sites are updated with the latest data every two to three months. We maintain the Ensembl Archive sites so that there are stable links to data from a particular release. As of December 2016 these will be available for <strong>five years</strong>, together with the following longer term archives:
<ul>
<li>Annotation on the <strong>human NCBI36 assembly</strong> is available at our <a href="http://may2009.archive.ensembl.org//Homo_sapiens/Info/Index">Ensembl 54 archive</a> site.</li>
<li>Annotation on the <strong>mouse NCBIm37 assembly</strong>is available at our <a href="http://may2012.archive.ensembl.org//Mus_musculus/Info/Index">Ensembl 67 archive</a> site.</li>  
<li>As from August 2014 we are supporting the <strong>human GRCh37 assembly</strong> at our dedicated <a href="http://grch37.ensembl.org/index.html">GRCh37 human</a> site. Unlike the other Ensembl archive sites, this will be  maintained and updated with new features with each release of Ensembl.</li>
</ul>
Archived databases are also maintained for at least 10 years. Currently all databases are available from 2004. More information is available from our <a href="/info/data/mysql.html">MySQL database documentation</a>. We also maintain data archives from 2004 available from our <a href="ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/">FTP site</a>.

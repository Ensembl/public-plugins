<h2>Assembly and annotation</h2>

<p>The Mouse Genomes Project is an ongoing effort to sequence the genomes of the common laboratory mouse strains, cataloguing all forms of molecular variation. They have produced <i>de novo</i> assemblies and strain-specific gene annotation for 16 laboratory and wild-derived strains (129S1/SvImJ, A/J, ARK/J, BALB/cJ, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6NJ, CAST/EiJ, CBA/J, DBA/2J, FVB/NJ, LP/J, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HlLtJ, PWK/PhJ, SPRET/EiJ, and WSB/EiJ) from a mixture of short- and long-range illumina libraries, optical maps, and third generation sequencing.</p>

<p>The strain-specific genome annotation was created by a combination of mapping over Gencode M8 mouse transcripts, strain-specific RNA-seq to refine mapped transcripts with Augustus, and Augustus CGP (comparative gene prediction) with strain-specific RNA-seq to annotate novel or private transcripts.</p>

<p>The assemblies and annotation were loaded into the Ensembl framework and additional analyses were run. These included: repeatmasking using Repeatmasker; <i>ab initio</i> gene predictions from Genscan; CpG island identification; prediction of transcription start sites using Eponine; tRNA predictions from tRNAscan; alignments of sequences from UniProt, UniGene and the ENA vertebrate RNA collection. Protein domains were annotated using InterProScan.</p>

<h2>Comparative analysis</h2>

<p>The Mouse Genomes Project has provided a multiple alignment of all their genomes with <i>Mus musculus</i> and <i>Rattus norvegicus</i> in the form of a HAL file generated by the progressive-Cactus aligner. Additionally, we have computed a LastZ alignment of human and <i>Mus spretus</i>.</p>

<p>We provide two sets of gene-trees and orthologues in Ensembl. The standard gene-trees and orthologues comprise genes from one representative for every Ensembl species, whilst the Murinae-specific gene-trees and orthologues comprise genes from all mouse strains and include genes from <i>Mus musculus</i>, <i>Mus spretus</i> and <i>Rattus norvegicus</i>. A stepwise approach via one these three species is required in order to compare genes from mouse strains to genes from species not in the Murinae set.</p>

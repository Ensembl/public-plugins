<h2>Assembly and annotation</h2>

<p>The Mouse Genomes Project [https://www.mousegenomes.org/] is an ongoing initiative to sequence and catalogue molecular variation across common laboratory mouse strains. Currently, high-quality reference genomes are available for 16 inbred strains (129S1/SvImJ, A/J, ARK/J, BALB/cJ, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6NJ, CAST/EiJ, CBA/J, DBA/2J, FVB/NJ, JF1/MsJ, LP/J, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HlLtJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ) [https://www.mousegenomes.org/reference-genomes/] created using a combination of short- and long-range Illumina libraries, optical maps, and third-generation sequencing data.</p>

<p>The strain-specific genome annotations were generated by mapping GENCODE M30 [https://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse/release_M30.html] genes and transcripts via the Ensembl Human automated annotation system [https://beta.ensembl.org/help/articles/human-genome-automated-annotation], supplemented by methods from the Ensembl vertebrate annotation pipeline [https://beta.ensembl.org/help/articles/vertebrate-genome-annotation]. Mapped GENCODE structures served as the primary evidence with gaps in the annotations filled using aligned short-read transcriptomic data and full-length transcripts derived from PacBio IsoSeq long-read data.</p>

<h2>Comparative analysis</h2>

<p>Using our EPO pipeline, we generated a multiple genome alignment of 16 of the
   reference-quality genomes from the The Mouse Genomes Project with <i>Mus
   musculus</i>, <i>Rattus norvegicus</i> and an additional three <i>Mus</i>
   species&colon; <i>Mus caroli</i>, <i>Mus pahari</i> and <i>Mus
   spicilegus</i>. Additionally, we have computed a LastZ alignment of <i>Mus
   spretus</i> and the three additional <i>Mus</i> species against the <i>Mus
   musculus</i> reference genome.</p>

<p>We provide multiple sets of gene-trees and orthologues in Ensembl, two of
   which include genes from a mouse genome. The standard gene-trees and
   orthologues comprise genes from representatives of selected Ensembl species,
   whilst the Murinae-specific gene-trees and orthologues comprise genes from
   all mouse strains and include genes from <i>Mus musculus</i>, <i>Rattus
   norvegicus</i>, <i>Mus spretus</i> and the three aforementioned <i>Mus</i>
   species. A stepwise approach via one of these six species is required in
   order to compare genes from mouse strains to genes from species not in the
   Murinae set.</p>

<p>In accordance with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale_Agreement">Fort Lauderdale Agreement</a>, please check the publication status of the genome/assembly before publishing any genome-wide analyses using these data.</p>

<p>The ASM334442v1 assembly was submitted by Jackson Laboratory on July 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 231,673 contigs assembled into 111,495 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 27,247 while the scaffold N50 is 189,900.</p>

<p>The USDA_NASsal_1.1 assembly was submitted by USDA/ARS on January 2022. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 3,008 contigs assembled into 1,755 scaffolds. From these sequences, 27 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 4,207,077 while the scaffold N50 is 16,202,286.</p>

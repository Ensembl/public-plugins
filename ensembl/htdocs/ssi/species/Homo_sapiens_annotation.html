<p>The Ensembl human gene annotations have been updated using Ensembl's automatic
      annotation pipeline. The updated annotation incorporates new protein and
      cDNA sequences which have become publicly available since the last GRCh38
      genebuild (December 2013).</p>

<p>In the current release, we continue to display a
      joint gene set based on the merge between the automatic annotation from
      Ensembl and the manually curated annotation from Havana. See the
      statistics table, right, for the corresponding GENCODE version number. The
      Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) identifiers have also been mapped to the
      annotations. More information about the <a
        href="/info/genome/genebuild/ccds.html">CCDS project.</a></p>

<p>Updated manual
      annotation from Havana is merged into the Ensembl annotation every
      release. Transcripts from the two annotation sources are merged if they
      share the same internal exon-intron boundaries (i.e. have identical
      splicing pattern) with slight differences in the terminal exons
      allowed. Importantly, all Havana transcripts are included in the final
      Ensembl/Havana merged (GENCODE) gene set.

<p>The black-capped squirrel monkey (<i>Saimiri boliviensis</i>) is a South American squirrel monkey, found in Bolivia, Brazil and Peru. This South American monkey can be found in numerous zoos (with over 80 zoos keeping them in Europe alone, the majority of them being of the Bolivian subspecies) around the world, including the Ellen Trout Zoo, London Zoo, Apenheul Primate Park, Copenhagen Zoo and Auckland Zoo.</p>

<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly available).

For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.
Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold.

Pseudogenes were calculated by looking at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the genome.</p>

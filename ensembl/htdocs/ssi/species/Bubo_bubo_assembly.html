<p>The BubBub1.0 assembly was submitted by GEROMICS on February 2020. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 133,317 contigs assembled into 35,666 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 37,091 while the scaffold N50 is 8,019,613.</p>

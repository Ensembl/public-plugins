<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.</p>

<p>Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold</p> 

<p>Pseudogenes were calculated by looking at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the genome.</p>

 <p>lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could be found in the transcript.</p>

<p>
The olive baboon assembly was annotated using a standard Ensembl gene annotation system, incorporating RNAseq data provided through a collaboration
between the <a href="http://nhprtr.org" target"_blank">Nonhuman Primate
        Reference Transcriptome Resource</a> and the <a
        href="http://hgsc.bcm.edu" target="_external">Human Genome Sequencing
        Center,</a> Baylor College of Medicine.</p>

<h3>RNASeq data set</h3>
<p>In addition to the Ensembl gene set, we produced RNASeq-based gene models and
      an indexed BAM file for each of the fourteen tissue samples used by the
      RNASeq pipeline and also for the merged data from all tissues. Each
      RNASeq-based gene model represents only the best supported transcript
      model. We did a BLASTp of these transcript models against UniProt proteins
      of protein existence level 1 and 2 in order to annotate the open reading
      frame. The best BLAST hit is displayed as a transcript supporting
      evidence.</p>

<p>A total of 13548 gene models in the Ensembl gene set include RNAseq data as
      supporting evidence. Of these 13548 gene models, 8520 are annotated
      exclusively from RNASeq data, with a further 5028 gene models annotated
      using a combination of RNASeq data and other protein evidence. The RNASeq
      data were used to add UTR to protein coding models.</p>

<p>The tissue-specific sets of transcript models built using our RNAseq pipeline
      are as follows:</p>
<table class="ss tint">
  <tr><th>Tissue</th><th>Number of gene models</th></tr>
<tr class="bg1"><td>bone marrow</td><td>9323</td></tr> 
<tr class="bg2"><td>cerebellum</td><td>10947</td></tr>

<p>Additional splice junctions (introns) may have been identified by our
      pipeline and not included in the best supported transcript model. We
      therefore provide users with the full set of introns identified by our
      RNAseq pipeline to enable further analysis. These introns were identified
      by searching for reads that splice when mapped to the genome.</p>

<p>The AnoCar2.0 assembly was submitted by Broad Institute on September 2011. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 41,987 contigs assembled into 6,646 scaffolds. From these sequences, 13 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 79,867 while the scaffold N50 is 4,033,265.</p>

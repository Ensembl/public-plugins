<p>The ASM1607732v2 assembly was submitted by Dairy Cattle Research Center, Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences on October 2021. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 1,468 contigs assembled into 50 scaffolds. From these sequences, 32 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 25,073,460 while the scaffold N50 is 98,589,534.</p>

<p>The ASM303372v1 assembly was submitted by Centre for GeoGenetics on April 2018. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 49,709 contigs assembled into 9,021 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 134,070 while the scaffold N50 is 15,144,613.</p>

<p>The OctDeg1.0 assembly was submitted by Broad Institute on 2012/05/01 . The assembly is on the Scaffold level, consisting of 259,905 assembled into 7,135 scaffolds.

The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 19,847 while the scaffold N50 is 12,091,372

The genome assembly represented here corresponds to GenBank Assembly ID: GCA_000260255.1</p>

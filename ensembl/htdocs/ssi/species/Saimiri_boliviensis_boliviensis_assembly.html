<p>The SaiBol1.0 assembly was submitted by Broad Institute on 2011/11/17 . The assembly is on the Scaffold level, consisting of 151,414 assembled into 2,686 scaffolds.

The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 38,823 while the scaffold N50 is 18,744,880

The genome assembly represented here corresponds to GenBank Assembly ID: GCA_000235385.1</p>

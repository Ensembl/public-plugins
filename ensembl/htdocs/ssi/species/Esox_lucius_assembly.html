<p>The fEsoLuc1.pri assembly was submitted by Vertebrate Genomes Project on March 2020. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 165 contigs assembled into 53 scaffolds. From these sequences, 25 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 22,630,263 while the scaffold N50 is 37,473,588.</p>

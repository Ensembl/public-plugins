<p>The Soccid_v01 assembly was submitted by California Academy of Sciences on September 2017. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 28,713 contigs assembled into 8,108 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 159,062 while the scaffold N50 is 3,983,020.</p>

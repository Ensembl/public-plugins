<p>The MesAur1.0 assembly was submitted by Broad Institute on 2013/03/29 . The assembly is on the Scaffold level, consisting of 237,700 assembled into 21,484 scaffolds.

The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 22,511 while the scaffold N50 is 12,753,307

The genome assembly represented here corresponds to GenBank Assembly ID: GCA_000349665.1</p>

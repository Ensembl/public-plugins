<p>The fAnaTes1.2 assembly was submitted by SC on December 2018. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 317 contigs assembled into 51 scaffolds. From these sequences, 23 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 7,055,436 while the scaffold N50 is 25,063,394.</p>

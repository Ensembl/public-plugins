<p>The bGalGal1.mat.broiler.GRCg7b assembly was submitted by Vertebrate Genomes Project on January 2021. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 677 contigs assembled into 214 scaffolds. From these sequences, 41 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 18,834,961 while the scaffold N50 is 90,861,225.</p>

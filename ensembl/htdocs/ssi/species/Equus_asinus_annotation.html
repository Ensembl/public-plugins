<p>The donkey or ass (Equus africanus asinus) is a domesticated member of the horse family, Equidae. The wild ancestor
  of the donkey is the African wild ass, E. africanus. The donkey has been used as a working animal for at least 5000
  years. There are more than 40 million donkeys in the world, mostly in underdeveloped countries, where they are used
  principally as draught or pack animals. Working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below
  subsistence levels. Small numbers of donkeys are kept for breeding or as pets in developed countries.A male donkey or
  ass is called a jack, a female a jenny or jennet; a young donkey is a foal. Jack donkeys are often used to mate with
  female horses to produce mules; the biological &quot;reciprocal&quot; of a mule, from a stallion and jenny as its
  parents instead, is called a hinny.Asses were first domesticated around 3000&nbsp;BC, probably in Egypt or
  Mesopotamia, and have spread around the world. They continue to fill important roles in many places today. While
  domesticated species are increasing in numbers, the African wild ass is an endangered species. As beasts of burden
  and companions, asses and donkeys have worked together with humans for millennia.</p>
<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping
  from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly
  available). For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of
  transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.
  Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold. Pseudogenes were calculated by looking
  at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of &lt;10bp), where the gene was covered in
  repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the
  genome. lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could
  be found in the transcript.</p>

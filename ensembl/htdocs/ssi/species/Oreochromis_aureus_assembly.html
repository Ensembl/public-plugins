<p>The ZZ_aureus assembly was submitted by University of Vienna on June 2020. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 1,026 contigs assembled into 304 scaffolds. From these sequences, 22 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 4,182,292 while the scaffold N50 is 40,723,988.</p>

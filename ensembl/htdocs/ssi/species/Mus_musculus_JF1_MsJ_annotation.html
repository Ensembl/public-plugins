<p>Genome annotation was generated by mapping GENCODE M30 [https://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse/release_M30.html] genes and transcripts via the Ensembl Human automated annotation system [https://beta.ensembl.org/help/articles/human-genome-automated-annotation], supplemented by methods from the Ensembl vertebrate annotation pipeline [https://beta.ensembl.org/help/articles/vertebrate-genome-annotation]. Mapped GENCODE structures served as the primary evidence with gaps in the annotations filled using aligned short-read transcriptomic data and full-length transcripts derived from PacBio IsoSeq long-read data.</p><p>In accordance with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale_Agreement">Fort Lauderdale Agreement</a>, please check the publication status of the genome/assembly before publishing any genome-wide analyses using these data.</p>

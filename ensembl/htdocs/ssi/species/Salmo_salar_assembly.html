<p>The ICSASG_v2 assembly was submitted by International Cooperation to Sequence the Atlantic Salmon Genome on June 2015. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 368,060 contigs assembled into 241,573 scaffolds. From these sequences, 29 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 57,618 while the scaffold N50 is 1,366,254.</p>

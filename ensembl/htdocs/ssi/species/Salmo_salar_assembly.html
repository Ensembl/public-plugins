<p>The Ssal_v3.1 assembly was submitted by Norwegian University Of Life Sciences on April 2021. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 4,222 contigs assembled into 4,222 scaffolds. From these sequences, 29 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 28,058,890 while the scaffold N50 is 28,058,890.</p>

<p>The Naked mole-rat paternal assembly was submitted by hospital for sick children on July 2022. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 2,350 contigs assembled into 32 scaffolds. From these sequences, 30 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 2,890,005 while the scaffold N50 is 94,825,129.</p>

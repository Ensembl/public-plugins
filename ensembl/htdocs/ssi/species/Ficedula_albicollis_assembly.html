<p>The FicAlb1.5 assembly was submitted by Uppsala University on June 2013. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 30,843 contigs assembled into 21,836 scaffolds. From these sequences, 33 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 410,964 while the scaffold N50 is 6,542,656.</p>

<p>The mRatBN7.2 assembly was submitted by Wellcome Sanger Institute on January 2021. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 757 contigs assembled into 176 scaffolds. From these sequences, 22 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 29,198,295 while the scaffold N50 is 135,012,528.</p>

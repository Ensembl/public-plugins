<p>The Oar_rambouillet_v1.0 assembly was submitted by Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center on November 2017. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 7,486 contigs assembled into 2,641 scaffolds. From these sequences, 27 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 2,572,683 while the scaffold N50 is 107,697,089.</p>

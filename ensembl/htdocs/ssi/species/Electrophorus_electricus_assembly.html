<p>The fEleEle1.pri assembly was submitted by Vertebrate Genomes Project on June 2020. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 315 contigs assembled into 89 scaffolds. From these sequences, 26 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 7,062,559 while the scaffold N50 is 25,664,172.</p>

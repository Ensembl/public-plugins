<p>The Nfu_20140520 assembly was submitted by Leibniz Institute For Age Research - Fritz Lipmann on January 2016. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 74,941 contigs assembled into 6,013 scaffolds. From these sequences, 19 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 19,950 while the scaffold N50 is 15,858,201.</p>

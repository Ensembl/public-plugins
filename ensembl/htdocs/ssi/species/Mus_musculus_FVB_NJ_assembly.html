<p>The assembly for FVB/NJ was generated as part of The Mouse Genomes Project [https://www.mousegenomes.org/], additional strains can be found in Ensembl [https://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/Info/Strains].</p><p>The assembly is on the chromosome level, consisting of 2818 contigs assembled into 376 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 1916862 while the scaffold N50 is 126399372.</p>

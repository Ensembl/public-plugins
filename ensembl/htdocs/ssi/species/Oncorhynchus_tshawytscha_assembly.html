<p>The Otsh_v2.0 assembly was submitted by Fisheries and Oceans Canada on May 2021. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 9,983 contigs assembled into 9,978 scaffolds. From these sequences, 34 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 2,884,253 while the scaffold N50 is 2,884,253.</p>

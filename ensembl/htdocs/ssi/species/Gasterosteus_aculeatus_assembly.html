<p>The GAculeatus_UGA_version5 assembly was submitted by University of Georgia on February 2021. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 6,059 contigs assembled into 2,937 scaffolds. From these sequences, 22 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 485,752 while the scaffold N50 is 20,445,003.</p>

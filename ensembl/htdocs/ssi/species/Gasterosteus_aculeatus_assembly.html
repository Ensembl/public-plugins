cDNAs and ESTs being provided by the <a href="http://www-shgc.stanford.edu/resources/stickleback.html">Stanford Human Genome Center</a>.
The assembly has been sequenced by whole-genome shotgun 
sequencing with a base coverage of approximately 11x. The stickleback 
genome is approximately 460 Mb in length and comprises 22 pairs of 
chromosomes (groups) including a mitochondrial chromosome and an 
additional 1,822 unplaced supercontigs.

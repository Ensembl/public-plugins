<p>The ROS_Cfam_1.0 assembly was submitted by The Roslin Institute on September 2020. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 951 contigs assembled into 376 scaffolds. From these sequences, 40 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 12,024,593 while the scaffold N50 is 64,037,277.</p>

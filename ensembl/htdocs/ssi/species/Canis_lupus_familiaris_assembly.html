<p>The CanFam3.1 assembly was submitted by Dog Genome Sequencing Consortium on November 2011. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 27,106 contigs assembled into 3,310 scaffolds. From these sequences, 39 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 267,478 while the scaffold N50 is 45,876,610.</p>

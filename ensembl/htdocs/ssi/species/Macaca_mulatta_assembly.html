<p>The Mmul_10 assembly was submitted by The Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine on March 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 3,182 contigs assembled into 2,979 scaffolds. From these sequences, 22 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 46,608,966 while the scaffold N50 is 82,346,004.</p>

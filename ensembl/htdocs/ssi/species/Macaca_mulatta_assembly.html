<p>The Mmul_8.0.1 assembly was submitted by the Baylor College of Medicine in
      2015. The assembly is on the chromosome level, consisting of 348,493
      contigs assembled into 286,262 scaffolds/22 chromosomes.</p>
<p>The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in
      blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is
      107,172 while the scaffold N50 is 4,193,270. This large contig and
      scaffold N50 has allowed for a much more complete annotation of the rhesus
      macaque genome that the previous annotation on Mmul_1.0.</p>

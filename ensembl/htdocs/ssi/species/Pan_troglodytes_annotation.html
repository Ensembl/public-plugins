<p>The taxonomical genus Pan (often referred to as "Chimpanzees" or "chimps") consists of two extant species: the common chimpanzee and the bonobo. Together with humans, gorillas and orangutans they are part of the family Hominidae (the great apes). Bonobos and common chimpanzees are the only species of great apes that are currently restricted in their range to Africa. Native to sub-Saharan Africa, common chimpanzees and bonobos are currently both found in the Congo jungle, while only the common chimpanzee is also found further north in West Africa. In 2017, the UN backed Convention of Migratory Species held in The Philippines selected chimpanzee for protection .</p>

<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly available).

For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.
Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold.

Pseudogenes were calculated by looking at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of <10bp), where the gene was covered in repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the genome.</p>

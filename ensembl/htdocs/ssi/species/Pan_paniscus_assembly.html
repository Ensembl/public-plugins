<p>The panpan1.1 assembly was submitted by Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology on 2015/08/18 . The assembly is on the Chromosome level, consisting of 121,356 assembled into 10,984 scaffolds.

The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 66,676 while the scaffold N50 is 8,197,324

The genome assembly represented here corresponds to GenBank Assembly ID: GCA_000258655.2</p>

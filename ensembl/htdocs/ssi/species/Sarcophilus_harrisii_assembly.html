<p>The mSarHar1.11 assembly was submitted by SC on November 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 445 contigs assembled into 106 scaffolds. From these sequences, 8 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 62,339,597 while the scaffold N50 is 611,347,268.</p>

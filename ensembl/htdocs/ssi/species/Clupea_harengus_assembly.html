<p>The Ch_v2.0.2 assembly was submitted by Uppsala Univeristy on March 2021. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 3,714 contigs assembled into 1,724 scaffolds. From these sequences, 26 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 1,006,413 while the scaffold N50 is 29,845,739.</p>

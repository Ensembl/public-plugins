<p>Gallus_gallus-5.0 was annotated using a standard Ensembl genebuild
pipeline, incorporating RNASeq data (<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB12891">PRJEB12891</a>)
and PacBio long read data (<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB13248">PRJEB13248</a>,

<h3>PacBio long read data set</h3>

<p>Two tissue samples were sequenced using the PacBio long read sequencing
technology, embryo and brain. Both sets were used to add UTR to gene models
and as input source for our lincRNA discovery pipeline. The embryo set was
sequenced using 5' and 3' capping, therefore all the sequences were considered
as full length cDNAs and incorporated into the gene models.</p>

<h3>RNASeq data set</h3>

<p>In addition to the main set, we have predicted gene models for each  
tissue type using the RNA-Seq pipeline. We did a BLASTp of these models  
against UniProt proteins of vertabrate species with protein existence  
level 1 and 2 in order to confirm the open reading frame (ORF). The best  
BLAST hit is displayed as a transcript supporting evidence. The data was
also used to add UTR to gene models.</p>

<p>The tissue-specific sets of transcript models built using our RNAseq  
pipeline are as follows:</p>

<p>The OryCun2.0 assembly was submitted by The Broad Institute on October 2009. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 84,024 contigs assembled into 3,318 scaffolds. From these sequences, 22 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 64,648 while the scaffold N50 is 35,972,871.</p>

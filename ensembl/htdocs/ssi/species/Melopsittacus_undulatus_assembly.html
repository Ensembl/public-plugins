<p>The bMelUnd1.mat.Z assembly was submitted by G10K on April 2020. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 1,148 contigs assembled into 864 scaffolds. From these sequences, 32 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 16,636,420 while the scaffold N50 is 104,092,594.</p>

<p>This site provides a data set based on the December 2013 <i>Homo sapiens</i> high
      coverage assembly GRCh38 from the <a
        href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/index.shtml">Genome Reference Consortium</a>. This
      assembly is used by UCSC to create their hg38 database. The data set
      consists of gene models built from the genewise alignments of the human
      proteome as well as from alignments of human cDNAs using the cDNA2genome
      model of exonerate.(/p>

<p>
This release of the assembly has the following properties:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>contig length total 3.4 Gb.</li>
  <li>chromosome length total 3.1 Gb (excluding haplotypes).</li>
</ul>

<p>It also includes 261 alt loci scaffolds, mainly in the LRC/KIR complex on
      chromosome 19 (35 alternate sequence representations) and the  <a
        href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2206249/?tool=pubmed">MHC region
      on chromosome 6</a> (7 alternate sequence representations).</p>

<h3 style="clear:both">Patches</h3>
    <p>As the GRC maintains and improves the assembly, patches are being
      introduced. Currently, assembly patches are of two types:
    <ul>
      <li>Novel patch: new sequences that add alternative sequence at a loci and
        will remain as haplotypes in the next major assembly release by GRC</li>
      <li>Fix patch: sequences that correct the reference sequence and will
        replace the given region of the reference assembly at the next major
        assembly release by GRC.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

<h3>Neanderthal genome</h3>

<p>A preliminary assembly of the Neanderthal (<i>Homo sapiens neanderthalensis</i>) genome is available via the
<a href="http://projects.ensembl.org/neandertal/">Neanderthal
        Genome Browser</a>,
an Ensembl-powered project based at the Max Planck Institute.</p>

<p>The fAstCal1.3 assembly was submitted by Wellcome Sanger Institute on June 2021. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 739 contigs assembled into 249 scaffolds. From these sequences, 22 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 4,438,245 while the scaffold N50 is 38,669,361.</p>

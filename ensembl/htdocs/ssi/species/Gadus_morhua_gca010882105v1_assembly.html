<p>The gadMor_Celtic assembly was submitted by CIGENE on February 2020. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 1,253 contigs assembled into 1,127 scaffolds. From these sequences, 23 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 10,559,872 while the scaffold N50 is 27,362,751.</p>

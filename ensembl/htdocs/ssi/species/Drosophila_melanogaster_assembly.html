<p>Ensembl uses the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (<a href="https://www.fruitfly.org">BDGP</a>) assembly <a href="https://fb2017_05.flybase.org/static_pages/feature/previous/articles/2014_07/FB2014_04.html">release 6</a> (July 2014). In contrast to release 5, regions without a chromosome assignment are stored as distinct scaffolds, rather than on a single pseudo-chromosome, and heterochromatin regions are incorporated in the chromosomal arms.</p>

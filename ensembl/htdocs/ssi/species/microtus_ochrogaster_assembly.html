<p>The MicOch1.0 assembly was submitted by Broad Institute on 2012/12/07 . The assembly is on the Chromosome level, consisting of 187,012 assembled into 6,450 scaffolds.

The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 21,250 while the scaffold N50 is 17,270,019

The genome assembly represented here corresponds to GenBank Assembly ID: GCA_000317375.1</p>

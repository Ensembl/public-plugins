<p>The GRCm39 assembly was submitted by Genome Reference Consortium on September 2017. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 885 contigs assembled into 336 scaffolds. From these sequences, 21 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 32,273,079 while the scaffold N50 is 52,589,046.</p>

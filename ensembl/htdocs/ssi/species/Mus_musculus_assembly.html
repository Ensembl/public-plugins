<p>
This site features the latest major assembly release for mouse. The primary assembly, GRCm38, was released by the 
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/assembly/grc/mouse/index.shtml">Genome Reference Consortium</a> in January 2012. 
It is based on <i>Mus musculus</i> strain C57BL/6J. This assembly is used by UCSC to create their mm10 database.
</p>

<p>

The GRCm38 primary assembly comprises 21 chromosomes and 22 unplaced scaffolds. 
Similar to the human genome assembly, the Genome Reference Consortium will be 
releasing additional sequence for GRCm38 in the form of minor releases (patches).

<h3 style="clear:both">Patches</h3>

<p>
As the GRC maintains and improves the mouse reference assembly, patches are being introduced. These patches do not change the coordinates of the primary assembly. 
For more information, please see our <a href='http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/genebuild/assembly.html' title='click to view Genome Assemblies help document'>Genome Assemblies help document</a>.
Patch release one (GRCh38.p1) was included in Ensembl release 70.

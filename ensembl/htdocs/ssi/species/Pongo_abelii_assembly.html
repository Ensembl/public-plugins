<p>The Susie_PABv2 assembly was submitted by University of Washington on January 2018. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 5,814 contigs assembled into 5,300 scaffolds. From these sequences, 24 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 11,074,009 while the scaffold N50 is 98,475,126.</p>

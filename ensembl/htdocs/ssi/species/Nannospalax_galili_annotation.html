<p>The Upper Galilee Mountains blind mole-rat (Spalax galili) is an extant species of subterranean rodent within the family Spalacidae, indigenous to Upper Galilee in northern Israel. Following the identification of S. galili in 2001, Nevo et al. recorded specimens in the vicinity surrounding the Kerem Ben Zimra settlement.</p>

<p>The gene annotation process was carried out using a combination of protein-to-genome alignments, annotation mapping from a suitable reference species and RNA-seq alignments (where RNA-seq data with appropriate meta data were publicly available).

For each candidate gene region, a selection process was applied to choose the most appropriate set of transcripts based on evolutionary distance, experimental evidence for the source data and quality of the alignments.
Small ncRNAs were obtained using a combination of BLAST and Infernal/RNAfold.

Pseudogenes were calculated by looking at genes with a large percentage of non-biological introns (introns of <10bp), where the gene was covered in repeats, or where the gene was single exon and evidence of a functional multi-exon paralog was found elsewhere in the genome.

lincRNAs were generated via RNA-seq data where no evidence of protein homology or protein domains could be found in the transcript.</p>

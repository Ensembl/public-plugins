<p>The Turkey_5.1 assembly was submitted by Turkey Genome Consortium on October 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 250,220 contigs assembled into 187,695 scaffolds. From these sequences, 32 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 27,076 while the scaffold N50 is 3,898,092.</p>

<p>The ARS-UCD1.3 assembly was submitted by Usda Ars on May 2022. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 2,343 contigs assembled into 1,957 scaffolds. From these sequences, 30 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 25,896,116 while the scaffold N50 is 103,308,737.</p>

<p>The Panubis1.0 assembly was submitted by University of California, San Francisco on October 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 15,213 contigs assembled into 11,145 scaffolds. From these sequences, 22 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 1,464,978 while the scaffold N50 is 140,274,886.</p>

<p>The second assembly of the olive baboon (<i>Papio anubis</i>) genome was
      provided by the Baylor College of Medicine in June 2012. The assembly has
      20 autosomal chromosomes numbered 1-20 and a sex chromosome labelled
      X. The assembly contains a total sequence length of 2.95Gb with 55.1Mb of
      gaps. There are 72,500 scaffolds (63,229 unplaced) comprised of 198,931
      contigs with a scaffold N50 of 528.9Kb and a contig N50 of 40.2Kb. The N50
      size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of
      the N50 size or longer.</p>

<p>The SLUC_FBN_1 assembly was submitted by Leibniz Institute for Farm Animal Biology (FBN) on September 2019. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 1,348 contigs assembled into 1,313 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 4,695,595 while the scaffold N50 is 4,929,547.</p>

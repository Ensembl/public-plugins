<p>The NGI_Narwhal_1 assembly was submitted by The Narwhal Genome Initiative on May 2019. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 25,295 contigs assembled into 6,972 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 255,327 while the scaffold N50 is 107,566,389.</p>

<p>The Ssal_Brian_v1.0 assembly was submitted by Norwegian University Of Life Sciences on June 2022. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 2,991 contigs assembled into 2,979 scaffolds. From these sequences, 28 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 27,893,759 while the scaffold N50 is 27,893,759.</p>

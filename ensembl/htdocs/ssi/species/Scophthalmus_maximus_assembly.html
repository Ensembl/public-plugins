<p>The ASM1334776v1 assembly was submitted by CIGENE on June 2020. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 178 contigs assembled into 127 scaffolds. From these sequences, 22 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 20,466,349 while the scaffold N50 is 25,949,660.</p>

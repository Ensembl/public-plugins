<p>The Amazon molly (<i>Poecilia formosa</i>) genome sequence was produced 
in October 2013 by the Aquatic Genome Models Consortium.</p>

<p>The genome is 1Gb in length, consisting of 3,985 toplevel sequences, all 
of which are unplaced scaffolds (from 31,058 contigs). The N50 of the 
contigs of the submitted assembly is 57.47 Kb and the N50 of the 
scaffolds is 1.574 Mb. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the 
assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer.</p>

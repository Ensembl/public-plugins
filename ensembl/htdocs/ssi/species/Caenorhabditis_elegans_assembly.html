<p>
Genome sequence and annotation have been imported from the WS230 release
of WormBase (which includes the WBcel215 version of the <i>C.elegans</i>
reference genome). Included are annotated operons, genes, transcripts and
translations, as well as RNAi and BLAST/BLAT homology data. In addition
Affymetrix and Agilent cross references for <i>C.elegans</i> expression arrays
have been added.
</p>

<p>
We include <i>C.elegans</i> in Ensembl (and also Ensembl Genomes) to allow people to
access the data through the Ensembl user interface (both for visualisation
and data mining) and to provide cross-species integration through our
comparative genomics resources (such as homologous gene links and protein
family pages).

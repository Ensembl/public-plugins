<p>The Oar_v3.1 assembly was submitted by International Sheep Genome Consortium on September 2012. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 130,765 contigs assembled into 5,698 scaffolds. From these sequences, 27 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 40,376 while the scaffold N50 is 100,079,507.</p>

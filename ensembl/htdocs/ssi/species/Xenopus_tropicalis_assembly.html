<p>The UCB_Xtro_10.0 assembly was submitted by University of California, Berkeley on November 2019. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 851 contigs assembled into 167 scaffolds. From these sequences, 10 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 14,634,335 while the scaffold N50 is 153,961,319.</p>

<p>The Naked mole-rat maternal assembly was submitted by hospital for sick children on July 2022. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 2,224 contigs assembled into 32 scaffolds. From these sequences, 30 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 3,438,577 while the scaffold N50 is 95,752,777.</p>

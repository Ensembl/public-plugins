<p>The CEY_v1 assembly was submitted by Institute of Special Wild Economic Animals and Plants, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences on February 2020. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 39,708 contigs assembled into 17,927 scaffolds. From these sequences, 34 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 268,660 while the scaffold N50 is 77,688,133.</p>

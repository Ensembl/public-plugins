<p>The ASM222487v1 assembly was submitted by BGI on July 2017. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 137,297 contigs assembled into 20,089 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 33,496 while the scaffold N50 is 2,077,029.</p>

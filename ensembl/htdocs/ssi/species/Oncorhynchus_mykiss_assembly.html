<p>The USDA_OmykA_1.1 assembly was submitted by USDA/ARS on September 2020. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 1,229 contigs assembled into 939 scaffolds. From these sequences, 32 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 15,579,713 while the scaffold N50 is 39,165,350.</p>

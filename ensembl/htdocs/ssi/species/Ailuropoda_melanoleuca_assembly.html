<p>The ASM200744v2 assembly was submitted by Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences on May 2020. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 127,086 contigs assembled into 77,288 scaffolds. From these sequences, 21 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 127,380 while the scaffold N50 is 129,245,720.</p>

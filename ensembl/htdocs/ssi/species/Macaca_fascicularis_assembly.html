<p>The Macaca_fascicularis_6.0 assembly was submitted by Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center on March 2020. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 1,496 contigs assembled into 936 scaffolds. From these sequences, 21 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 21,344,639 while the scaffold N50 is 150,377,965.</p>

<p>The assembly for C57BL/6NJ was generated as part of <a href="https://www.mousegenomes.org/">The Mouse Genomes Project </a>, additional strains can be found in <a href="https://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus/Info/Strains">Ensembl</a>.</p><p>The assembly is on the chromosome level, consisting of 798 contigs assembled into 208 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 8304515 while the scaffold N50 is 126851431.</p>

<p>The Mmur_2.0 assembly was submitted by the Baylor College of Medicine in
      2015. The assembly is on the scaffold level, consisting of 56,281 contigs
      assembled into 10,311 scaffolds.</p>

<p>The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in
      blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs 182,929
      while the scaffold N50 is 3,711,085. This represents a major improvement
      over Mmur_1.0 where these figures were 3.51kb for contigs and 107.02 kb
      for supercontigs. This improvement in contig and scaffold N50 has allowed
      for a much more complete annotation of the mouse lemur genome.</p>

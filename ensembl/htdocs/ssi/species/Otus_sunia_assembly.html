<p>The OtuSun1.0 assembly was submitted by GEROMICS on February 2020. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 151,517 contigs assembled into 108,826 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 52,366 while the scaffold N50 is 18,540,887.</p>

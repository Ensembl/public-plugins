<p>The ASM2253959v1 assembly was submitted by Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology on March 2022. The assembly is on chromosome level, consisting of 1,808 contigs assembled into 354 scaffolds. From these sequences, 24 chromosomes have been built. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 812,338 while the scaffold N50 is 36,880,113.</p>

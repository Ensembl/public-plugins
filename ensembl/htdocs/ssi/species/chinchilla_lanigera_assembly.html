<p>The ChiLan1.0 assembly was submitted by Broad Institute on 2012/08/28 . The assembly is on the Scaffold level, consisting of 81,656 assembled into 2,839 scaffolds.

The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 61,105 while the scaffold N50 is 21,893,125

The genome assembly represented here corresponds to GenBank Assembly ID: GCA_000276665.1</p>

<p>This is the first release of the low-coverage 2.19X assembly of rock  
hyrax (<em>Procavia capensis</em>). The genome sequencing is provided by
the <a href=" http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/">Human Genome Sequencing Center</a>, 
Baylor College of Medicine and assembly is provided by the

The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies  
in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for supercontigs  
is 20.42 kb and is 3.38 kb for contigs. The total number of bases in  
supercontigs is 2.95 Gb and in contigs is 2.41 Gb.

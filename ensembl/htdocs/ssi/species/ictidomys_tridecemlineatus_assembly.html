<p>The SpeTri2.0 assembly was submitted by Broad Institute on 2011/11/29 . The assembly is on the Scaffold level, consisting of 153,488 assembled into 12,483 scaffolds.

The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 44,137 while the scaffold N50 is 8,192,786

The genome assembly represented here corresponds to GenBank Assembly ID: GCA_000236235.1</p>

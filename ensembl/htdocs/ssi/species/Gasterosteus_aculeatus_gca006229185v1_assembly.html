<p>The BOT assembly was submitted by Institute of Ecology and Evolution on June 2019. The assembly is on scaffold level, consisting of 37,160 contigs assembled into 18,433 scaffolds. The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 32,541 while the scaffold N50 is 312,209.</p>

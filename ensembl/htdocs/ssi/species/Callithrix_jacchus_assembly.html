<p>The ASM275486v1 assembly was submitted by the Broad Institute on 2017/11/06. The assembly is on the scaffold level, consisting of 88,439 contigs assembled into 39,944 scaffolds. 

The N50 size is the length such that 50% of the assembled genome lies in blocks of the N50 size or longer. The N50 length for the contigs is 155,284 while the scaffold N50 is 129,239,660.</p>

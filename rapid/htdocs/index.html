        <p>Ensembl Rapid Release is a new site to make data available more quickly. 
Release of data occurs on a two-week cycle, meaning we can make our gene sets available 
with minimum delay once the annotation is complete. In addition to the gene sets itself, 
we provide additional features such as protein feature annotation and BLAST functionality,
 to help investigate these genomes.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that Ensembl Rapid Release by nature is not as fully featured 
as a typical data release on <a href="https://www.ensembl.org">www.ensembl.org</a>. Currently 
we do not provide homology data, gene symbol assignment (which uses homology data), 
data archiving or programmatic access. We are however working on adding more functionality 
over the coming months to further improve usability.</p>

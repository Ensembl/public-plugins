        <p>Ensembl Rapid Release is a new site designed to make our data available more quickly. 
Release of data occurs on a two-week cycle, meaning we can make our gene sets available with 
minimal delay once the annotation is complete. For each species we provide a gene set along with 
additional features such as protein feature annotation and BLAST functionality.</p>

        <p>It is important to note that Ensembl Rapid Release is by nature not as fully featured 
as a typical data release on <a href="https://www.ensembl.org">www.ensembl.org</a>. Currently 
we do not provide homology data, gene symbol assignment (which uses homology data), 
data archiving or programmatic access. We are however working on adding more functionality 
over the coming months to further improve usability.</p>

<h1>The Ensembl Rapid Release Cycle</h1>

<p>With the huge increase in sequencing planned by the Vertebrates Genome Project and Darwin Tree of Life, we have taken the decision to release these new genomes as quickly as possible &ndash; ideally within a couple of weeks of receiving them. However the normal Ensembl release cycle is based around a process of data integration that takes several months to complete, from our first receiving an assembly to the public release of the data on our website and FTP site. This new Rapid Release site therefore takes an approach of minimal integration, using a simplified version of the genebuild pipeline.</p>.

<p>As a result of this approach, there is currently no variation, regulation or comparative data for these species, and genes have not been assigned HGNC symbols. In a few cases, such as new assemblies of major species already present on our main site (www.ensembl.org), we may release the data here with additional annotation.</p>

<p>The protein coding genes on this site have been generated using a modified Ensembl genebuild supported by protein evidence.</p>

<p>The first ORF representing approximately 67% of the entire genome that encodes 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) has been split into two genes: ORF1a and ORF1ab. The remaining ORFs encode accessory proteins and four major structural proteins: spike surface glycoprotein (S), small envelope protein (E), matrix protein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N) [Wu A et al. 2020].</p>
<p>
There are also annotated protein features using InterProScan (version 5.43-78.1), alignments to Rfam covariance models using cmscan (<a href='https://rfam.org/covid-19'>Rfam 14.2</a>) and a GO import using dedicated SARS-CoV-2 GPAD files from GOA.
</p>
<p> The gene annotation imported from ENA for this reference (submitted by the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, Fudan University, Shanghai, China) can also be viewed as an additional track. <p>

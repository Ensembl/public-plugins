<p>The protein coding genes on this site have been generated by the Ensembl genebuild pipeline using the latest set of RefSeq proteins. 

The first ORF representing approximately 67% of the entire genome that encodes 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) has been split into two genes: ORF1a and ORF1ab.

The remaining ORFs encode accessory proteins and four major structural proteins: spike surface glycoprotein (S), small envelope protein (E), matrix protein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N).

There are also annotated protein features using InterProScan (version n.n), alignments to Rfam covariance models using cmscan and a GO import.

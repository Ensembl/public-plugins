<p>SARS-CoV-2 mutation data is made available as a phylogenic tree by <a href='https://nextstrain.org/'>Nextstrain</a>[Hadfield 2018], which is an open-source project to harness the scientific and public health potential of pathogen genome data. The Nextstrain project uses subsamples of the available genome sequence data to provide a real-time snapshot of evolving SARS-CoV-2 populations and creates visualisations to interrogate these over time and by region. The 2020-04-08 version of http://data.nextstrain.org/ncov.json is used here.

The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence data used in the Nextstrain analysis were collected and made available by <a href='https://www.gisaid.org/'>GISAID</a>. Many groups contributed pre-publication sequence data to GISAID;  please see the <a href='https://www.gisaid.org/'>GISAID site</a> for a full list of attributions.

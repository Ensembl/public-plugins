<p>We used Cactus to align SARS-CoV-2 and 60 publicly available virus genomes from the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily resulting in 78% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome aligned with at least one other genome and 35% of the genome aligned with the complete set of Orthocoronavirinae genomes. We have also applied our gene tree methods to group the protein coding genes into families and to predict orthologous and paralogous relationships between genes.</p>

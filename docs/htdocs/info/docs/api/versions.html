<h1>Ensembl Versions</h1>

<p>
This page uses release [[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]] as a version example.
We recommend always using the latest versions of code and data.
</p>


<h2>Ensembl Versioning Scheme</h2>
            
<p>
Each Ensembl release has an integer version number associated with it which is used to 
identify the correct versions of the API, web code and databases that make up that release.
The idea is that components with the same release version should work together - i.e. any web site built with
'version [[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]]' API and web code, and 'version [[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]]' 
databases should work correctly.
</p>


<h2>Archiv<em><span class="blue">e</span><span class="red">!</span></em> sites</h2>

<p>
Previous releases of Ensembl from at least the last five years are archived to support long running data analysis projects. Other archiv<em><span class="blue">e</span><span class="red">!</span></em>s, for example those providing significant releases of human annotation such as that on the <a href="http://may2009.archive.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/Index">NCBI36 assembly"</a>, are maintained for longer. 
For more information about the Archiv<em><span class="blue">e</span><span class="red">!</span></em>
sites and <a href="/info/website/archives/assembly.html">past assemblies</a>, see the
<a href="/info/website/archives/">list of current archives</a>.
</p>


<h2>Ensembl Code Versioning</h2>

<p>
For the APIs and the web code, a git branch (essentially a named snapshot of the code) is made 
for each release and named with the release version number.
The
<a href="api_installation.html">Perl API</a> and
<a href="/info/docs/webcode/mirror/install/ensembl-code.html#cvs_co">web code</a>
can be checked out of git with the branch "release/versionnumber",
e.g. release/[[SPECIESDEFS::ENSEMBL_VERSION]].
</p>


<h2>Ensembl Data Versioning</h2>

<p>
The Ensembl database names have the format:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;species&gt;&lt;database type&gt;&lt;release number&gt;&lt;assembly version&gt;
</pre>

<p>
As an example, the name of the Human Core database for the Ensembl 95 release on the GRCh38 assembly would be:
</p>

<pre>
homo_sapiens_core_95_38
</pre>

<p>
A letter suffix to the data version indicates a change in data without a change in assembly; e.g. a new gene build.
</p>


<h2>BioMart Versioning</h2>

<p>
BioMart code will branch less frequently than Ensembl, and the release number bears no relation to that of Ensembl.<br/>
Biomart data release cycle instead follows Ensembl's and the release number agrees with the latter one.

<h1>Ensembl Tools Configuration</h1>

<h2 id="Intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>Since release 75, we have been moving our online tools to a 
new modular system that can be installed on any external site,
without any dependencies on proprietary software. These tools
can be integrated into any Ensembl-powered site, and modified
by project developers to use any backend architecture required.</p>

<h2>System architecture</h2>

<p>The basic components of the system are:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <b>ticket database</b>, allowing retrieval and storage of jobs</li>
<li>a <b>dispatcher</b> and, for BLAST only (at present), an optional <b>queueing system</b> to run the jobs. The dispatcher and queueing system use Ensembl eHive by default, but
can be replaced by other custom modules which use different technologies,
such as the Ensembl REST API.</li>
<li>two plugins to the ensembl webcode:
  <ul> 
  <li><b>public-plugins/tools</b>, which provides the user interface and manages the ticketing system
  <li><b>public-plugins/tool_hive</b>, which manages job submission to eHive</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, you will need the ensembl-orm codebase, which is a database access layer
used by several web plugins, including user accounts. If you already have user accounts
set up on your Ensembl mirror, they will automatically be available to the tools system,
but it is not necessary to have accounts enabled in order to run Ensembl Tools.</p>

<h2>Software installation</h2>

<h3>1. Download code</h3>

<p>First, set up your Ensembl mirror site as per the main <a href="/info/docs/webcode/mirror/">installation instructions</a>.</p>

<p>Then, in the same directory as the rest of your Ensembl code, clone the 
<a href="https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-orm">ensembl-orm</a> repo from 
GitHub, if you don't already have it.</p>

<p>To use the eHive dispatcher you will also need to follow the <a href="https://rawgit.com/Ensembl/ensembl-hive/HEAD/docs/install.html">eHive installation instructions</a>.</p>

<h3>2. Create data files directory</h3>

<p>All of the Ensembl tools use some kind of index/cache files for fast data
processing, and it makes sense to keep all of them in the same place for easy 
maintenance. Create this directory somewhere that the webserver can access, e.g.
in the same directory as your ensembl git repositories. For example if you've
used the default location given in the main installation instructions, you
might put your data files in <kbd>/usr/local/ensembl/tools_data/</kbd>.</p>

<h3>3. Configure</h3>

<p>Configure the additional plugins in ensembl-webcode/conf/Plugins.pm as shown below:</p>

<p><pre>
  'EnsEMBL::Mirror'      =&gt; $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_SERVERROOT.'/public-plugins/mirror',
  'EnsEMBL::Tools_hive'  =&gt; $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_SERVERROOT.'/public-plugins/tools_hive',
  'EnsEMBL::Tools'       =&gt; $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_SERVERROOT.'/public-plugins/tools',
  'EnsEMBL::Ensembl'     =&gt; $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_SERVERROOT.'/public-plugins/ensembl',
  'EnsEMBL::Docs'        =&gt; $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_SERVERROOT.'/public-plugins/docs'
</pre></p>

<p>Configure connections to the database server(s) where you wish to host your 
tools and ehive databases, in public-plugins/mirror/conf/ini-files/MULTI.ini:</p>

<pre>
[databases]

[DATABASE_WEB_TOOLS]
HOST = myhost
PORT = 3306
USER = myuser

[DATABASE_WEB_HIVE]
HOST = myhost
PORT = 3306
USER = myuser
</pre>

<p>Note that you don't need to configure database names, as default names are provided in the plugins.</p>

<h3>4. Restart your mirror website</h3>

<p>In order to pick up the plugins and compile any required database settings, JavaScript, etc into your site, you will need to run <kbd>ctrl-scripts/restart</kbd> with the -r flag.</p>

<p>Note: the code will complain that it can't find your ensembl_web_tools database, but that's OK - ignore the warning and continue with installation.</p>

<h3>5. Create your tools database</h3>

<p>From the tools plugin, run <kbd>utils/create_tools_db.pl</kbd> to set up the ensembl_web_tools MySQL database.</p>

<h3>6. Set up individual tools</h3>

<p>Each tool can be added to the interface separately, so for example you don't need to
set up BLAST if you only need the VEP. However all tools are enabled by default, so
if you don't need a tool, you should disable it in public-plugins/mirror/SiteDefs.pm.
For example:</p>

<pre>
  $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_BLAST_ENABLED  = 0;
  $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_VEP_ENABLED    = 1;
  $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_AC_ENABLED     = 0;
</pre>

<p>For each enabled tool, you will need to do additional set-up - see the table below 
for links to the instructions.</p>

<p>The following tools have been ported to the new interface:</p>

<table class="ss">
<thead>
<tr><th>Tool</th><th></th><th></th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="bg2">
  <td>BLAST/BLAT</td>
  <td><a href="blast.html">Setup instructions</a></td>
  <td><a href="/Help/View?id=451">User guide</a></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>VEP</td>
  <td><a href="vep.html">Setup instructions</a></td>
  <td><a href="/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html">User guide</a></td>
</tr>
<tr class="bg2">
  <td>Assembly Converter</td>
  <td><a href="assembly_converter.html">Setup instructions</a></td>
  <td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

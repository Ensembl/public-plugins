  <h1>Configuring an Ensembl Website</h1>

<p>
  This section explains the configuration changes you have to
  make so that Ensembl will run on your local set-up.</p>
  
<p>
  N.B. If you installed Ensembl prior to release 31 you will have edited files
  in the conf directory. From version 32 there is a new
  approach to configure the site using plugins.
</p>

<h2>Setting up the "Mirror Plugin"</h2>

<p>
  In the main <kbd>ensembl-webcode/conf</kbd> directory you will find a file called <strong>Plugins.pm-dist</strong>.
  Copy this file and name it Plugins.pm (i.e. without the -dist extension).
  This file sets up any plugins required by the website, including the mirror plugin mentioned above.
</p>

<pre class="code">
$SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_PLUGINS = [
  'EnsEMBL::Mirror'    =&gt; $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_SERVERROOT.'/public-plugins/mirror',
  'EnsEMBL::Ensembl'   =&gt; $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_SERVERROOT.'/public-plugins/ensembl'
  'EnsEMBL::Docs'      =&gt; $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_SERVERROOT.'/public-plugins/docs'
];
</pre>

<div class="box box1 float-right" style="width:40%">
<h2>Background: configuration</h2>

<h3>Plugins</h3>

<p>
  The default configuration files can all be found in the "conf"
  subdirectory of your server-root.
     The site-wide configuration (Apache config, global settings) 
     is stored in <kbd>conf/SiteDefs.pm</kbd>.  
</p>

<p>
  Elsewhere in the documentation you will read about how to <a href="/info/docs/webcode/dev/">extend</a>
  Ensembl by writing your own <strong>plugins</strong>. A by product
  of this extensibility is that you can also use plugins to simply
  configuration of your server.

  For example, in your checked-out copy of Ensembl there is a 
  <strong>public-plugins/mirror</strong> directory.  The 
   <strong>mirror/conf</strong> directory contains DEFAULTS.ini 
   and SiteDefs.pm files which can be used to configure your copy of Ensembl.
</p>

<h3>Configuring the available species</h3>

<p>If you wish to add to or remove from the full list of species on the main 
Ensembl website, please see the documentation on <a
          href="/info/docs/webcode/dev/">extending Ensembl</a>.</p>
</div>


<p>As you can see, the default mirror setup uses two plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>public-plugins/ensembl</code>, which contains all the species configuration files, species
home pages and public documentation</li>
<li><code>public-plugins/mirror</code>, which contains only the files needed to configure your mirror</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the array of plugins is in order of precedence, so that in the default setup, the mirror
plugin  overrides the base Ensembl one. <strong>DO NOT</strong> edit the files in <code>public-plugins/ensembl</code>,
as your changes may be overwritten when you update to the next release.</p>

<p>
  Now go into the <strong>public-plugins/mirror/conf</strong> directory and
  make the changes listed below to SiteDefs.pm and ini_files/DEFAULTS.ini:
</p>

<h3>public-plugins/mirror/conf/SiteDefs.pm</h3>

<p>
  First copy SiteDefs.pm-dist to SiteDefs.pm in this directory.
  If you open this file in a text editor, such as vi, you will see it is
  a Perl module with a single method "update_conf" which 
  contains the changes needed to configure your copy of the website.

  The "update_conf" method consists of a list of variables (of the form $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_whatever),
</p>
<p>
  Below are the variables you will need to change to match your installation. 
  If you wish, you can change any variables that are defined in the main SiteDefs.pm file.
</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You should only change the values, that is the parts between single quotes.</p>

<h4>General configuration</h4>

<p>$SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_SERVERROOT sets the filesystem location of the web server root directory. By default, this is
determined dynamically based on the location of the SiteDefs.pm file. You can, however, hard-code this
value if you wish. For example, if you installed the Ensembl site in /usr/local/ensembl, then you could
change this line of SiteDefs to read:</p>
<pre class="code">
  $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_SERVERROOT = '/usr/local/ensembl';
</pre>

<h4>Configuration of the Apache web server</h4>
<p>Change $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_SERVERNAME to the web name of the server - e.g. "www.yoursite.org". This value is
dynamically set to the server hostname by default.</p>
<p>Change $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_USER and $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_GROUP to the system user and group you want the Apache
web server to run as. Usually, for security, this is a special user (such as "nobody") who has very few
permissions.</p>

<h4>Configuration of hubCheck (optional)</h4>

<p>If you have <a href="/info/docs/webcode/mirror/install/non-ensembl-code.html#hubCheck">installed hubCheck</a>, 
you need to add the location of the binary file to SiteDefs as follows:</p>
<pre class="code">
  $SiteDefs::HUBCHECK_BIN = '/path/to/hubCheck';
</pre>

<p>If this path is not configured, track hubs can still be attached but hubCheck will not be run to validate them.</p>

<h4>Mail configuration - error messages</h4>
<p>If you want errors to be automatically emailed to you, change $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_MAIL_ERRORS to the value 1,
and change $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_ERRORS_TO to your email address. If you don't want errors mailed, set
$SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_MAIL_ERRORS to 0.</p>

<h4>Temporary Files</h4>

<p>There are three temporary file locations that can be configured:</p>
<pre class="code">
  $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_TMP_DIR       General storage for temporary files
  $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_TMP_DIR_IMG   Storage for image files
  $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_TMP_DIR_BLAST Storage for blast files
</pre>
<p>The values for these should be set to an appropriate filesystem path.</p>

<p>Some temporary files need to be referenced by URL from web pages. The first two tmp directories
above therefore have URL aliases, also configured within SiteDefs.pm. You should not need to edit
these.</p>
<pre class="code">
  $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_TMP_URL       URL alias for $ENSEMBL_TMP_DIR
  $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_TMP_URL_IMG   URL alias for $ENSEMBL_TMP_DIR_IMG
</pre>
<p>There are two further temporary file configuration options available:</p>
<ul>
<li>$SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_TMP_CREATE If set, then at apache startup the server will attempt to create
any temporary directories that have been configured, but
which don't already exist. It also changes their ownership to
$SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_USER.$SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_GROUP</li>
<li>$SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_TMP_DELETE If set, then at apache startup the server will attempt to delete
the contents of $ENSEMBL_TMP_DIR and
$SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_TMP_DIR_IMG.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="species_ini">public-plugins/mirror/conf/ini-files/DEFAULTS.ini <br />and public-plugins/mirror/conf/ini-files/[Species_name].ini</h2>
<p>
Again the first thing to do is make a copy of the DEFAULTS.ini-dist file as DEFAULTS.ini,
then you will need to go in and edit the appropriate lines of the DEFAULTS.ini.
</p>
<p class="notice">
  From version 33 onwards you should be able to re-use the same Plugins.pm, SiteDefs.pm and
  DEFAULTS.ini file to configure your new Ensembl.
</p>

<p>The format of the species-specific .ini files are similar to a standard windows ini file, i.e. split into
sections identified by a header in square brackets, which contain key = value entries. When the Apache
server is started, these files are parsed and stored in a file called config.packed in the conf directory.
This config.packed file is regenerated whenever the server is restarted.</p>

<h3>Database configuration</h3>
<p>In the [general] section, change the values of DATABASE_DBUSER and DATABASE_DBPASS to the
username and password you want MySQL to be accessed by. Set DATABASE_HOST and
ENSEMBL_HOST_PORT to be the database server and port that MySQL is running on.</p>

<p>These are default settings - you can override them by adding a section for a particular database. For
example, adding a section like the following into the mirror plugin would override the defaults in public-plugin for the ENSEMBL_WEBSITE database:</p>
<pre class="code">
[DATABASE_WEBSITE]
USER=mysqluser2
PASS=helppass
HOST=mysqlserver2
PORT=4444
</pre>

<h3 id="fonts">Fonts</h3>
<p>
  Ensembl uses TrueType fonts in its images, so these need to be configured in 
the '[ENSEMBL_STYLE]' section of the DEFAULTS.ini file.
</p>
<pre class="code">
[ENSEMBL_STYLE]
GRAPHIC_FONT         = arial                           ; Arial file is arial.ttf
GRAPHIC_FONT_FIXED   = cour                            ; Courier file is cour.ttf
GRAPHIC_TTF_PATH     = /usr/local/share/fonts/ttfonts/ ; remember the trailing slash
GRAPHIC_FONTSIZE     = 8                               ; Default font-size for graphic text...
</pre>
<p>
  You will likely need to change the path to where your local copy
  of these files is stored. Please note that Mac TTF files
  are a slightly different format and do not reliably work.
</p>


<h2>public-plugins/mirror/conf/ini-files/MULTI.ini</h2>

<p>Create this file to configure the multi species databases.  Configure the [general] section for connection to the MySQL server, as for the species-specific ini files.
In the [databases] section, change the values of DATABASE_COMPARA entry
to match the name of the ensembl_compara database that you created.</p>

<p>In addition, if you chose to install a local GO database you can configure it here by adding an entry:</p>
<pre class="code">
DATABASE_GO = your_go_database_name
</pre>
<p>to the [databases] section along with DATABASE_COMPARA.</p>

<h3>Session database</h3>
<p>Change the values of the following to have the details for your web_user database</p>
<pre class="code">
[ENSEMBL_SESSION]
HOST = sessiondb_host
USER = sessiondb_user
PASS = sessiondb_password
</pre>

<p>Remember this database needs a user with update/insert/delete privileges. Additionally if you wish
to change the encryption keys used to "protect" the cookies, $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_ENCRYPT_0 should
be a six digit hex-number and $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_ENCRYPT_1, _2 and _3 should each contain two alphanumeric
characters. Unless you are particularly concerned about people changing cookies, the default values
will probably do.</p>

<h2>BLAST</h2>
<p>BLAST is not installed by default.  You have to configure blast for a local installation. See documentation describing how to <a href="/info/docs/webcode/mirror/tools/index.html">configure BLAST</a>.</p>
<p>All relevant fasta files are on <a href="ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub">ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub</a>.</p>

<h2>Note on Ensembl Web Site Search</h2>

<p>By default, local installations of Ensembl use a simple search that just does SQL
searches against the database. This method is rather slow and crude, however. Also, it 
does not do cross species queries (too time consuming for MySQL queries).</p>

<p>The Ensembl web site uses the open-source Java-based 
<a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html">Lucene search engine</a>.
If you wish to use this search engine, you will need to download the Lucene software
and set up a suitable webservice, as well as generate your own search indices. A
utility script for generating indices is provided in /utils/indexing, and the Ensembl 
Lucene plugin (/public-plugins/lucene) can be used to connect to the webservice and 
provide a web interface.</p> 

<p>(Prior to release 63, Ensembl used <a href="http://www.exalead.com/software">Exalead</a>, which
requires a user license and could not be distributed as part of the Ensembl web code).</p>

<h2>Site Preparation</h2>
<p>cd into your server root and run the following commands:</p>
<pre class="code">
  mkdir logs
  chown -R $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_USER:$SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_GROUP .
</pre>
<p>where $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_USER and $SiteDefs::ENSEMBL_GROUP are the web server user &amp; group you configured in
SiteDefs.</p>

<p>Your Ensembl site should now be ready to start up.</p>

<div class="notice">
<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>

<p>Please note that the suggested set-up for Apache, mod_perl, MySQL and all Ensembl modules is not
intended to provide high-level security. We strongly recommend that you get your systems administrator
to audit any system that you provide to others. In particular, note that the perl.startup file in the conf
directory may be run as root, so be careful about permissions on this file.</p>

<p>We are not responsible for any damage or loss of data resulting or arising from running the Ensembl
website on your own machines.</p>

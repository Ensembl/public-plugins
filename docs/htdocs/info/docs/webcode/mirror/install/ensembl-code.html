<h1>Installing the Ensembl and BioPerl modules</h1>

<p>If you review the Site Structure part of this document, you will recall that the site is based around a
single server-root directory. The Ensembl and BioPerl modules are all installed into this
directory.</p>

<h2>Note about BioMart</h2>

<p>We no longer recommend installing BioMart as part of your Ensembl site.
We have had to hack the code to integrate it, and our hacks are not in a public git repo.</p> 

<p>You can download our mart databases from our FTP site for local access, with the following caveat; 
we are using biomart version 0.7, so you will need to install this legacy version from 
<a href="https://github.com/biomart">Biomart GitHub repository</a> as a standalone service.</br>
We are unable to support this installation as it is provided by an external project.</p>

<h2>Installation instructions</h2>

<p>Choose a suitable location, and create your server-root directory. For the purposes of
illustration, we will use /usr/local/ensembl. When following these instructions, replace /usr/local/ensembl 
with your chosen server-root.</p>

<div class="tinted-box">
<p><b>Important notice</b>: As of Release 75 we have moved development into git, and the old CVS server has
now been shut down. Releases from 32 onwards are available on <a href="https://github.com/Ensembl/">github.org</a>.</p>
</div>

<ol>
<li>Go to the server-root directory:
<code>cd /usr/local/ensembl</code>
</li>

<li id="cvs_co"><strong>Install the Ensembl modules</strong>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Clone Ensembl git tools from GitHub - this will make it fast and easy to clone Ensembl repositories</p>
  <pre class="code">
$ git clone https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-git-tools.git
$ export PATH=$PWD/ensembl-git-tools/bin:$PATH
</pre>
  </li>
  <li><p>To check out the most recent stable version of the ensembl API and web code from GitHub you need to use the latest branch of the code. This will be set as the default branch in GitHub.</p> 
  <pre class="code">
$ git ensembl --clone public-web
</pre>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p>N.B. You can also <a href="https://github.com/Ensembl" rel="external">view the Ensembl GitHub repository</a> in your web browser.</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Install the core BioPerl modules</strong> - see <a href="/info/docs/api/api_git.html">API installation documentation</a>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>A listing of your server-root should now look something like:</p>
  <pre>
bioperl-live
ensembl
ensembl-compara
ensembl-funcgen
ensembl-git-tools
ensembl-io
ensembl-orm
ensembl-tools
ensembl-variation
ensembl-webcode
public-plugins</pre>

</li>
</ol>

<p>You should now have all the Ensembl website code and data installed and ready to configure.</p>

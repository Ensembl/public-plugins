<title>What is a panel file</title>
<h1>What is a panel file?</h1>
<p>
All our variant call releases since <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20100804/" rel="external">20100804</a> have come with a panel file. This file lists all the individuals who are part of the release and the population they come from.
</p>

<p>
This is a tab delimited file which must have sample and population in its first two columns; some files may then have subsequent columns which describe additional information like which super population a sample comes from or what sequencing platforms have been used to generate sequence data for that sample.
</p>

<p>
The panel files have names like <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase1/analysis_results/integrated_call_sets/integrated_call_samples.20101123.ALL.panel" rel="external">integrated_call_samples.20101123.ALL.panel</a> or <a href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/integrated_call_samples_v2.20130502.ALL.panel" rel="external">integrated_call_samples_v2.20130502.ALL.panel</a>
</p>

<p>
These panel files can be used by <a href="http://grch37.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/index.html" rel="external">our browser tools</a>, the Data Slicer, Variant Pattern Finder and vcf to ped converter to establish population groups for filtering
